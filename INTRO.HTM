      <h1> Welcome</h1>
      <p>This learning material explores some issues and perspectives about active 
        citizenship and governance today at a variety of levels: local, national, 
        European, and Global. There are various learning activities embedded in 
        these materials. They provide those of you who are working in the community 
        with active citizens with a framework which should help you to reflect 
        on your own practice within these new perspectives.</p>
      <h2>Who is this learning material for?</h2>
      <p>The principal audience is a variety of citizenship educators such as: 
        community developers, community workers, community leaders, tutors in 
        further education colleges, youth workers, trade union tutors, and the 
        activists who are concerned with specific contemporary issues such as: 
        the environment, road safety, sexuality, gender, etc. Aspects of the package 
        will also be of value to the schoolteachers. In addition, the learning 
        material would be of value to a secondary audience such as: students of 
        secondary schools who are doing their school projects on citizenship and 
        active citizens themselves who have some role as educators (e.g., scout 
        and guide leaders), local politicians, policy makers, etc. </p>
      <p>This learning package does not require you to have any formal qualifications 
        in order to take part in the learning activities. However, it would be 
        desirable if you have the following background and skills:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>a background in the community (local and/or national level) as an 
            educator, organiser, catalyst, etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>some grasp of, and interest in issues related to local and national 
            political, social and economic aspects of the community and society</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>an appreciation of, and/or an interest in the contemporary social 
            issues such as exclusion, migration, European integration, Globalisation, 
            gender, the environment, etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>basic skills in using a computer to browse Web pages, use email and 
            word process simple documents. For those who are not familiar with 
            the above, an interest and willingness to learn these skills is needed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>access to a computer with Internet access either at home, work, or 
            in a public Internet access point such as an Internet caf√©, and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>ability to read and write simple English.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What does this learning material aim to achieve?</h2>
      <p>This learning material has been designed to provide a background to the 
        issues and perspective of active citizenship and governance today, and 
        to provide a framework for the educators to reflect on their own practice 
        within these new perspectives. It would enhance your understanding of 
        contemporary debates on citizenship and conceptual shifts given the current 
        changes and challenges facing the EU and nation states. It will introduce 
        you to the new perspectives on learning of active citizenship and governance, 
        and a range of innovative approaches to education/facilitations emerging 
        from the ETGACE research.</p>
      <p>The learning experience gained through a collaborative on-line learning 
        environment is aimed to create a 'sense of membership' of a 'citizenship 
        educator/facilitator community', thereby developing social networks amongst 
        the participants. The learning experience would also create a platform 
        for sharing information and concerns with regard to the practice of active 
        citizenship and governance. In general, the aim of the learning material 
        is to help the educators to become critical and better-informed practitioners 
        who would support each other's work.</p>
      <p>After using the learning package, we hope that you will be able to demonstrate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>a critical understanding of the various perspectives of active citizenship 
            and governance</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>a critical understanding the societal changes - local, national, 
            regional, and global, that are shaping the notion of citizenship in 
            the 21st Century and to reflect on the implications of these on your 
            own practice</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>an understanding of the range of barriers that prevent some sections 
            of the society from taking part an active role in the community (gender, 
            ethnicity, social class, economic conditions, etc.), and how these 
            barriers operate in the society</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>an understanding of how the above barriers could be taken into account 
            in fostering active citizenship and governance and designing educational 
            interventions</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>a knowledge of a variety of educational interventions to foster active 
            citizenship and governance taking into account the current changes 
            in the societal context, and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>the ability to improve the practice by taking into account the new 
            perspectives on learning active citizenship </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What is the content of this learning material?</h2>
      <p>This learning package is based around five themes related to active citizenship 
        and governance. Click on each of the theme below to view an outline of 
        the content under each of the theme. After viewing a page, click on the

        <li><b><a href="UNIT5/INDEX.HTM">Theme 5 - How can we facilitate learning 
          Active Citizenship and Governance?</a></b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>You will be exploring these themes through actual experiences of a number 
        of active citizens from six countries in Europe: England, Belgium, The 
        Netherlands, Finland, Spain, and Slovenia. We have gathered these materials 
        as part of a pan-European research project that explored how European 
        adults learn to become active citizens. We also explored some of these 
        issues using experiences of people such as yourselves who are working 
        with active citizens as educators, facilitating the development of active 
        citizenship in various ways.</p>
      <p>The learning material gives you an opportunity to reflect on your own 
        life and practice. You are encouraged to contribute ideas to a Discussion 
        Forum and interact with your fellow participants. The learning experience 
        will enable you to develop a 'sense of membership' of a 'citizenship educator/facilitator 
        community'.</p>
      <h2>Finally ...</h2>
      <p>Our overall objective in providing this on-line learning experience is 
        to create a platform where you can share information and concerns about 
        active citizenship and governance. Through the learning experience, we 
        hope you will become more critical and better-informed practitioners. 
        We also hope you will be more prepared to support each others' work.</p>
      <p>We hope to modify this learning material from time to time in the light 
        of the feedback received from users. Therefore, we invite you to use this 
        learning material and the discussion forum and provide us with your feedback 
        on the relevance, the userfriendliness, and any other aspects that you 
        might consider important in modifying this online learning package.</p>
      <p>We are also happy for other organisations to make use of this online 
        learning package either as a whole or sections of it for educational purposes, 
        provided that they acknowledge the source. Please email any queries to
