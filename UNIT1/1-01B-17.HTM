            <p class="quote"><b>Carlos</b> is an engineer who comes from an immigrant, 
              working-class family. He has been brought up in solidarity values 
              and in a commitment to the preservation of the environment. His 
              social orientation and worries led him first to participate in the 
              JOC (Young Working Christians) and later on to promote an organisation 
              co-ordinating body (an organisation co-ordinator) in Rubí. Recently, 
              an illness has made him to consume ecological and organic food only, 
              which has connected him to a co-operative concerned with responsible 
              consumption. This has led him to take a critical stance on environmental 
              matters. At present, he is starting up a co-operative in Rubí that 
              aims to achieve a widespread knowledge about this type of products. 
              At the same time, he continues to be linked to the movement through 
              the ACO (Catholic Working Action) and the organisation co-ordinator.
