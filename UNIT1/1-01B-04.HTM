            <p class="quote"><b>Ana</b> comes from a small town in the Slovenian 
              countryside where she has been living since she was a child. Her 
              parents were public servants. She has a family with two school children. 
              During her growing up and her university study she became concerned 
              with the protection of nature and preservation of traditional culture, 
              and also developed resistance to the state centralism in relation 
              to the regions. When democratic changes in Slovenia enabled political 
              pluralism she joined a newly established political party in her 
              region. She was quickly promoted in the hierarchy of the party. 
              In 1996 she was elected to the national parliament. During her mandate 
              she successfully participated in several regional developmental 
              projects. In addition to that she also extended her activities to 
              some social issues. Among others she participated in the parliamentary 
              commission for equal opportunities. Now, she is a vice mayor of 
              the commune where she lives. </p>
