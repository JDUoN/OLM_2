            <p class="quote"><b>Patricia</b> grew up in a working class family, 
              next to the church tower, after the first World War. The stories 
              and experiences her father and relatives shared with her about the 
              War had a deep influence on her and on the values she made her own. 
              As a child, she got to sit with her uncle in his barber shop and 
              she listened to all the conversations and debates about politics, 
              societal problems, possible solutions that took place. What she 
              learned in the barbershop is sometimes contradictory to what she 
              was told at school. This experience really shaped her value pattern 
              and her way of thinking (critical). Within her family and neighbourhood 
              she witnessed several injustices towards the working class people 
              which induced her devotion to the improvement of the working men's 
              and women's lives. She participated in the Catholic movement; from 
              the youth movement to the working class women's movement. She learned 
              about and took part actively in the emancipation of working class 
              and more specifically of the working class women. She became a social 
              worker and the first years of her career were devoted to improving 
              the situation (also structurally) of the families of railway workers. 
              Through her work as a social worker and her participation in the 
              women's movement, she got involved in local politics (own choice 
              + asked by the party), in the Christian Democratic Party (CVP). 
              From that time onwards, she started to devote her life to politics 
              (local and later national) and was quite successful (the road is 
              not without bends), especially at a time where women were a rare 
              species in national politics.</p>
