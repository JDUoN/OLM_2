            <p class="quote"><b>Victor</b> has been a local politician since 1999. 
              He studied engineering at University and works as an IT salesperson 
              for an international computer company but political activity takes 
              up most of his spare time. After helping at the general election 
              in 1990 he has helped with canvassing and attended political party 
              conferences from the age of 18. His father was involved in politics 
              in Greece and his family are all politically aware. He intends to 
              stand for council again in 2003 and then might try to get into Parliament 
              as an MP. Currently his support work for the Conservative Party 
              takes up more time than his council work. </p>
