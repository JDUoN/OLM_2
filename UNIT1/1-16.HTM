      <h1> A Framework identifying the multiple perspectives of Active Citizenship</h1>
      <p><b>Page 1 (of 2 pages)</b></p>
      <p>Let's try to develop a framework to help us recognise the diversity of 
        Active Citizenship and its multiple perspectives. At the outset we mentioned 
        the difficulty of coming to a common agreement about the concepts such 
        as 'active citizenship' and 'governance'. The stories that we have read 
        so far show that active citizens are involved in a variety of activities. 
        From these stories we can identify a number of main attributes, at least 
        four, around which we can develop our framework, as below.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Issues</b> can be a main attribute. People become active around 
          the issues that matter to them. For example, children's welfare was 
          Catherine's main concern. There were others who were concerned with 
          more than one issue.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li><b>Sphere of influence</b>, or <b>the</b> <b>geographical proximity 
          of activity</b>. While some people tend to limit their activities to 
          one level (Martha's activities tend to focus on the local political 
          arena), others are active at a variety of levels. For example, Catherine's 
          activity started from family level. Now she is active in her local area.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li><b>Role. </b>Individuals are active in a variety of roles, as you 
          have seen in their stories. Some are active in more than one role or 
          capacity. For example, Sandra is a founder of a new organisation to 
          empower people. She is also a fund-raiser.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li><b>Domains of life</b> could be the fourth category: private, civil 
          society, work, and state. </li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>Can you think of other ways of describing the diversity of active 
        citizenship? </b></p>
