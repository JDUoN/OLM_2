            <p class="quote"><b>Bor</b> was born to a conservative family, his 
              father is a miller, mother a secretary. He was influenced by his 
              father, who inoculated values in him like being honest, fighting 
              against injustice, and speaking out when you do not like something. 
              He thinks that this kind of breeding makes him "such an annoying 
              unionist". He decided to become a journalist when he was in the 
              fifth grade of primary school. After finishing college he went to 
              a faculty for social sciences and became a journalist at age of 
              25. He thinks he did not learn much at the faculty. During the faculty 
              he married his high school love. </p>
            <p class="quote">Bo is a father of two, with one on the way. He served 
              in the army in the former Yugoslavia, just at the time of increasing 
              tensions in the country. He attended the first democratic elections 
              there. He started to work for the national TV when he was in the 
              second year of college. He is still working there. He became a president 
              of the trade union in 1998. He said that he is doing that because 
              of the working collective. He added "I'm not going to make any compromises. 
              The members are the union, not me!". </p>
            <p class="quote">He is very busy so he would like to have more time 
              for his family. </p>
