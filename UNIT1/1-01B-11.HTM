            <p class="quote"><b>María</b> was born in Tarragona. She comes from 
              a higher middle-class family. The values of liberty and cultural 
              interest her family conveyed to her in her childhood have played 
              an important role in her social commitment later on in her life. 
              At age 19 she moved to Barcelona, where she contacted the scout 
              movement. The scout movement has deep roots in Catalonia and stood 
              out for its important role in the fight against Franco's dictatorship. 
              Later democratic political leaders in Catalonia received a kind 
              of progressive training based on the latest pedagogic tendencies 
              of the time in the scout movement. She was one of the trainers. 
              At the age of 27 she went back to Tarragona where she contributed 
              to the creation and development of the scout movement there. She 
              was also connected to a pedagogic renovation movement at that historic 
              moment. In particular, she defended the creation of a co-ed active 
              school, both secular and Catalan. Her job in this school led her 
              to a commitment to other themes, such as unions, the feminist movement, 
              etc. After her fight for a truly public school succeeded, she lost 
              her job as a teacher for she was considered not to have the required 
              qualifications. Then she started to work at a small shop and contributed 
              to the creation of a shopkeepers' union. She has now retired and 
              has more time to devote to social issues and to her voluntary work 
              with community organisation that promotes citizen participation.
