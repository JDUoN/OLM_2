            <p class="quote"><b>Alfonso</b> comes from a family with a low socio-economic 
              status. He has been committed to several Christian workers' associations: 
              JOC (Christian Working Youth) and ACO (Catholic Workers' Action), 
              as well as to a Marxist Leninist Party. Because of his illegal trade 
              union activity during the dictatorship he had been dismissed from 
              several companies and was also in prison for four months. His experience 
              in prison led him to distance himself from political parties, because 
              during those four months none of his party colleagues cared in the 
              least for his fate. He is also critical about unions that have too 
              vertical an organisation. He finds solidarity among workers crucial. 
              Nowadays, he is involved in the adult education movement, as well 
              as in an NGO connected to Venezuela. </p>
