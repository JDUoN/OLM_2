        Active Citizens - Descriptive Stories</h1>
      <p><b>Now we will read some descriptive stories of few individuals who are 
        active in variety of domains. </b></p>
      <p><b>Jaap from the Netherlands</b></p>
      <p>First let's read the story of Jaap, an active citizen from The Netherlands. 
        This story illustrates a person who is active in more than one domain 
        in life. While you read the story, look for instances where he moves from 
        one domain to another, and one kind of activity to another, and try to 
        identify the factors contributing to this process.</p>

          <td valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="88%" height="32"> 
            <p class="quote">Jaap was born in a Catholic family of 14 children. 
              As the youngest child, he had the privilege of going to school beyond 
              primary level. The others had to work in their father's cigar factory 
              soon after they completed primary schooling. After Junior High School, 
              Jaap started to work at the Post Office, which he didn't like. The 
              early career was an unsatisfying and blunt period for him. Working 
              at the Post Office was too sultry and restrictive for him. He says: 
              'selling stamps, counting money, all that nonsense. It was no challenge 
              to me.' He was among colleagues who were 'not interested in society', 
              and 'they never ever read a book.'</p>
            <p class="quote">Jaap moved on, and later on became an Executive in 
              a large company. There, he experiences injustice and very negative 
              power relations. He explains the situation: 'For example all engineers 
              automatically became directors. I tried to break that automatism 
              and abuse of power.' His attitudes and values lead to a conflict 
              with his superiors. Consequently he was dismissed from his duties. 
              While being bitter about this experience, Jaap feels proud about 
              his integrity and being able to maintain his values: 'I have always 
              been faithful to my own beliefs, [although] at that time, it ruined 
              my career.'</p>
            <p class="quote">Jaap also became a director of the Catholic trade 
              union for governmental employers at the age of 24. Most of his family 
              were involved in various types of associations and societies. After 
              five years however, he decided to leave the trade union. The values 
              of the union conflicted with his own values and attitude too much. 
              Jaap explains: 'At the end, I did not feel comfortable in the trade 
              union anymore. Most people were very biased and restricted, and 
              could be rather hard as well. In the union I felt like an analphabetic.'</p>
            <p class="quote">Education and personal development have always been 
              important to Jaap. To fulfill his hunger for social, cultural and 
              political knowledge, Jaap enrolled at the University of Leiden to 
              study Sociology . This was one of the best periods of life; he enjoyed 
              the sense of personal growth and development. </p>
            <p class="quote">After completing studies, Jaap became active in the 
              political domain. He thought that politics can contribute to solving 
              social problems: '[After studying Sociology] I realized there were 
              lots of blockades in society. I wanted to change the situation of 
              inequality and injustice. I thought by being politically active, 
              I could solve these problems.' </p>
            <p class="quote">Soon Jaap encountered difficulties with party politics. 
              He switched from a conservative party to a progressive political 
              party. The switching of political parties shows his search for integrity 
              and professionalism. He says: "Politics is rather hard. Ending up 
              in that circuit, you have to realize that you will get hurt. You 
              always have to be on your guard. I am branded by the machinery of 
              politics and government. Many people are hypocrites and bogus. I 
              am not like that. Honesty and integrity are very important standards 
              for me.'</p>
            <p class="quote">Besides his work and his activities in politics, 
              Jaap has also been active in the civil society. 'People knew me 
              from my activities in politics. Because I had good insight in government, 
              they asked me to contribute to different kind of interest groups.' 
              Jaap has been very active for the Catholic Church. He is active 
              in committees, counsels, foundations, and study groups, in a number 
              of capacities. 'The Evangel has always been very important for me. 
              In the Evangel as well as in my life, solidarity is an essential 
              topic.' He has been a member of numerous Boards: as a commissioner 
              in a housing association, a member for a domestic science school, 
              a member of his children's Montessori school, and an advisory member 
              in the social provision of services.</p>
            <p class="quote">Since his retirement, Jaap especially invests his 
              time in interest groups for elderly. He has been active as a secretary 
              for an elderly association, as the chairman of the study group 'policy 
              for elderly', as a member of the committee 'Day of the Elderly', 
              etc. Jaap wants to be important for the elderly people as long as 
              possible. Therefore, he tries to keep up with new developments in 
              the ever-changing world by reading world literature and actively 
              participating to all kinds of social organisations. </p>
            <p class="quote">Jaap takes an active caring role in his family too. 
              He has a some with schizophrenia and his wife is suffering from 
              dementia. Jaap feels very responsible for them and it is a lot of 
              effort to combine his social and political activities with the care 
              for his family. Jaap feels a very strong desire to stay active, 
              despite the problematic situation in the private domain. In order 
              to succeed in this, a very strict planning is inevitable.</p>
