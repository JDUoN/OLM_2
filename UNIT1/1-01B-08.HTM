            <p class="quote"><b>Pigga</b> is a former teacher. She is a Lappish 
              Same, currently a reindeer farm housewife, active in matters related 
              to ethnic and cultural Same issues and reindeer economy as well 
              as in artistic and tourism-related tasks. </p>
            <p class="quote">She has lived most of her life in Finland's most 
              Northern communities. In her childhood and and youth the Same life 
              was still traditional, although not in any way primitive. Reindeer 
              were important both economically and for home life and cultural 
              traditions. She compares the present way of life to the earlier 
              by saying that actually everything has stayed pretty much the same. 
              Although modern technology has made it even to Same farms, the family 
              and basic structure of cultural practices have according to her 
              experience not changed. Children in the family become now real Same 
              in essentially the same way as when she grew up.</p>
            <p class="quote">Her activism both professionally and in relation 
              to her native origin was based positively in her home life, where 
              the culture was acquired in a natural and unconstrained way. This 
              contrasted strongly with boarding school experiences in Sodankylä. 
              Because of the long distances children lived most of the terms in 
              a boarding school under close surveillance. The teachers were at 
              that time not Same, and they had no commitment to the native culture. 
              On the contrary, they wanted to integrate the children to Finnish 
              society as fully as possible. The discipline was strict, and they 
              were e.g. forbidden to speak their own language.</p>
            <p class="quote">After school Pigga gained various experiences of 
              life. Understanding how important one's own culture is, she acted 
              as a teacher. She lived in other places, too, so she knows Finnish 
              ways of life from many points of view. Because of that she feels 
              satisfied having married with Same reindeer farmer and returned 
              to the core of Same community. The Northern distances, and necessity 
              of developing livelihood are central to her, but she feels happy 
              that the various tasks can be done with her own family and tribe. 
              Even a modern Same farm is an enterprise, which must be developed 
              constantly. Pigga does not know how many reindeer they have, but 
              answers in the Same manner: "There are a few on the yard, and some 
              more on the other side of the tree - and there may be enough of 
              them even to the unseen side of the hill." The reindeer do not migrate 
              nowadays the same way as before, although they still are kept relatively 
              free. This has created a need to find more nourishment and Pigga 
              has taken an active role in experiments related to this. She is 
              also artistic, trying out both traditional handicraft methods and 
              later forms of artistic expression. This is also related to tourism, 
              which has become more and more important in Lapland during the years.</p>
            <p class="quote">The Same have been relatively successful in improving 
              their position in relation to the state, even their status as an 
              original native ethnic group has been ratified and they have got 
              their own parliament-like board. Pigga's family is involved in these 
              developments. Adult education is common in municipalities of Lapland, 
              and the adult education centres have also arranged open university 
              courses. These opportunities activated Pigga to improve her own 
              resources also by university studies, leading eventually to an EdM 
              degree. Research methods are useful also in developing methods of 
              reindeer farming. At the time when Pigga was telling this story, 
              she was just going to a press conference on the results of these 
              studies. She has also been presented on Finnish TV programmes, which 
              often shows the colourful Same life.</p>

              our own eyes what the life is like there. </p>
