            <p class="quote"> Rosalía has been engaged with social movements from 
              a very young age. She felt her initial period of social commitment 
              was a momentous one. Immediately after Franco's death she became 
              involved in youth associations, women's associations and cultural 
              associations.</p>
            <p class="quote">Currently, her participation in social movements 
              has decreased and she says she now focuses on fewer issues than 
              those in which she is really interested. She once participated in 
              a student exchange programme between Spain and Nicaragua through 
              an international solidarity NGO, as she believes it is important 
              to provide people from the Third World with an opportunity to study. 
              She is still involved in this NGO, but at a much lower level of 
              involvement. </p>
            <p class="quote">She works at a vocational training institute, and 
              she feels committed to her job. Her work targets young people of 
              different profiles, among them, young school dropouts. She thinks 
              that with these training programmes these people can have deeper 
              insight into the world of work and they can provide them with tools 
              that can help them for later entering the labour market. </p>

              <li>To what extent has her active citizenship been influenced by 
                the political climate in which she grew up? Which other stories

              <li>Rosalía's activities stretch to the global level as well. Have 
                you come across active citizens who take part in activities that 
                go beyond their local and national boundaries? What makes people 
                global citizens?
