      <h1> Characteristics of active citizenship - different perspectives</h1>
      <p>First, let's reflect on the stories that you have read so far. You may 
        have read all of them (24), or chosen to read a few that interested you. 
        While you were reading these stories, you may have jotted down some notes, 
        or given some thoughts to the guiding questions that appeared in each 
        page.</p>

            <p class="quote"><b>What kind of words did you use in order to describe 
              the active citizenship of each individual? What kinds of contexts

      <p>The active citizens used words such as a commitment to 'making a difference', 
        'getting things done' or 'changing things', wanting to 'help', 'doing 
        something worthwhile', 'putting something back into the community', having 
        a 'political consciousness', 'getting involved', 'tackling injustice' 
        and 'improving conditions'. Can we use these words as indicators or characteristics 
        of active citizenship?</p>
      <p>Their active citizenship activities were taking place in a number of 
        contexts such as at work, through the family environment (private domain), 
        community (civil society) or through public, elected office (state domain). 
      </p>
      <p>Active citizenship was connected to personal needs such as 'personal 
        development' 'doing more with one's life' and an 'opportunity to learn', 
        as well as due to a sense of social responsibility.</p>
      <p>We believe that active citizenship is some individual and/or collective 
        act of social responsibility towards others or on behalf of others. What 
        do you think?</p>
      <p>Active citizenship is therefore understood as something one does for 
        oneself as well as for others. Active citizenship is generally associated 
        with 'doing': doing with others and for others. It is also associated 
        with some form of cause - either social, political or developmental. These 
        could occur in a variety of areas of life: in the family, at work, in 
        the civil society, etc. </p>
      <p>Active citizenship also involves participation and involvement in decision 
        making processes that affect wider society. These processes of participation 
        and involvement can be referred to as 'governance.' </p>
      <p>Based on your notes, and our analysis, we'll try to develop a framework 
        that identifies and recognises diversity of active citizenship. </p>
      <p>Before that it would be helpful if you go on to browse some of the '<b>descriptive 
        stories</b>' that provide more insight into particular aspects of active 
        citizenship of some individuals.</p>
