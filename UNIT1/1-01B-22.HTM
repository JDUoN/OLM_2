            <p class="quote"><b>Miha</b> says he has been always interested in 
              decision making. He traces roots of this interest to his family. 
              He realised that being catholic narrowed down the possibilities 
              of his civic engagement and career possibilities and compromised 
              his expectations and ambitions according to this fact. As a young 
              man he sang in choruses and acted in amateur theatres. Later on 
              he actively participated in a youth organisation and local community, 
              both transmission belts of a socialist regime. During his university 
              studies he was actively engaged in a catholic student movement. 
              He finished his studies and became a successful middle manager. 
            </p>
            <p class="quote">In 1989 he contributed to the establishment of a 
              Christian Democratic Party of Slovenia (CDP) and made a swift party 
              career. In the first democratic elections he was elected as a member 
              of the national parliament. As a member of the Slovenian parliamentary 
              delegation he was lobbying in the institutions of the European Union, 
              arguing for an independent Republic of Slovenia. He even ran for 
              the position of the President of the Republic of Slovenia. Later 
              on he got a position of a high state officer but was forced to resign. 
              Afterwards he was appointed to another high level official position. 
              During the time of holding that position he finished his Masters 
              Degree in political sciences. Since after the termination of his 
              office he wasn't re-elected he rejoined the ranks of politicians 
              and took another office. </p>
