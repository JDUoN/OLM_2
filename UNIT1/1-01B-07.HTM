            <p class="quote"><b>Pamela</b> is the retired Head teacher of a school 
              for children with disabilities and learning difficulties. She is 
              now a local politician with responsibilities in a variety of areas 
              such as community policy, resources, planning and health. She was 
              born in the north of England just before the Second World war and 
              went to many different schools because of wartime circumstances. 
              At 18 she went to teacher training college in London, and got married 
              soon after she began her career as a teacher. Pamela became a teacher 
              in the special needs school, and few years later she separated from 
              her husband, and remained in the same school until she took early 
              retirement at the age of 55. In mid career she took a degree at 
              London University. During this time, she became involved through 
              a personal contact with a charity which found accommodation for 
              young people with schizophrenia coming out of hospital. After retirement, 
              she did not actively seek a political role but was approached and 
              asked if she would stand for a 'hopeless seat', which she then won 
              in 1995. She says that she 'gets a buzz from getting things done' 
              which help people. </p>
