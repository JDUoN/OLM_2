      <p>Rok is also an example of an active citizens whose activities have been 
        influenced by the political and economic developments in his country. 
        While you read the story, make notes of the various social responsibilities 
        he took up, and how these were influenced by the societal context. </p>

            <p class="quote">Rok completed his high school in a rather liberal 
              environment in a small town near the border with Italy, where he 
              felt very much 'at home'. Then he moved to Ljubljana (the Capital 
              of Slovenia) where he studied electrical engineering and later on 
              got employment. </p>
            <p class="quote">Rok is a successful businessman. After studying at 
              university, he took a job as an engineer in a large state-run factory 
              producing electrical appliances. Although quickly promoted, he was 
              not completely satisfied with his career development, especially 
              when he returned from military service. After a year's absence, 
              his projects had not moved forward. This was the beginning of the 
              economic restructuring, when many firms were uncertain about their 
              future, cut back on investment, and dismissing skilled professionals. 
            </p>
            <p class="quote">However, private initiatives also started to develop 
              in Slovenia at this time, mostly in the area of computer technology. 
              Many educated young people wished to become involved in this sector. 
              Rok found work as a manager in a commercial publishing firm. Because 
              of the changing national economic situation, he and his business 
              partner were able two years later to establish a private computer 
              firm. This transition to the private business sector was an important 
              turning point, not only in his career but in his private life. </p>
            <p class="quote">Rok's firm quite rapidly became a successful enterprise. 
              The success of the firm led to his involvement with issues arising 
              from the transition process in Slovenia. Groups of people, marginalised 
              and needing support, were seeking financial aid. Rok realised that 
              people were living in a very uneven society where a large section 
              of society is poor. The fragmentation of the socialist system has 
              not been beneficial to every one. Rok could not help everyone financially. 
              And he was left with the dilemma of whom to support. He thought 
              just donating money is not an effective way to bring about equality. 
            </p>
            <p class="quote">Rok decided he should tackle only the issues he knew 
              best. So he focussed his energy on his professional field - the 
              development of information technology. Around 1995 he started to 
              establish and gain proper status for the information and computing 
              area within the national Chamber of Commerce. He was the first chairperson 
              of the newly established association; now he is a member of its 
              board. </p>
            <p class="quote">Rok's critical awareness of the societal problems 
              was long standing. As a young student he was involved in organising 
              discussions on topics connected to the life of young people such 
              as drug abuse, although at that time (the late 1970s) drug addiction 
              was not yet a major issue in Slovenia. In addition, he regularly 
              contributed to the college newspaper. Also while studying at the 
              university he represented students in the faculty council.</p>
            <p class="quote"> In the mid-1990s, Rok joined the Rotary Club, where 
              he still remains active. First he was the secretary and now he is 
              a member of the steering committee. In both capacities he has been 
              able to influence the club's activities and work. </p>
            <p class="quote">On the other hand, he became very interested in the 
              emergence of the new economy and the information society. He has 
              devoted more and more of his time to it. 'I realised that the environment 
              where I have been living does not comprehend it in the way it was 
              introduced abroad, so I have increased my activities in this field. 
              I started to write and to participate in round tables, seminars 
              etc.' </p>
            <p class="quote">He joined the Slovenian 'Informatics' Society, is 
              now its vice-chairman, and has participated in various related projects. 
              He has been especially active in a project on 'Slovenia as an information 
              society', designed to promote the information society and lobby 
              for increased awareness of this important issue. A particular concern 
              is to influence key decision-making spheres (state administration, 
              politics, economy) to encourage them to make good decisions. He 
              helped prepare the blue book <i>Slovenia as the Information Society</i>. 
              The government later adopted this book as its national strategic 
              document in this field. Now Rok promotes the strategy by giving 
              lectures at professional events organised by 'Informatics' and by 
              the Research Association. In addition, he has a weekly column in 
              one of the main national daily newspapers, where he focuses on the 
              implications of information technology for people's lives. He also 
              helps in establishing information networks at the national level 
              as well as in joining international networks. </p>
            <p class="quote">Rok's activities in the work and civil society domains 
              intertwine with his private activities. His wife stopped working 
              when he established his firm, but she is not excluded from his work. 
              When he started the business there was no clear line between work 
              and family life: 'The work was almost like a hobby.' Many new and 
              interesting experiences were involved. He and his partner were relatively 
              inexperienced, so they often discussed issues with their families 
              and friends. When uncertain about how to manage charity activities, 
              Rok involved his wife in the search for adequate solutions.</p>
