            <p class="quote"><b>Salif</b> was born in Northern Morocco after the 
              second World War. Morocco was under 'protectorate' of Spain and 
              France at that time. He grew up under the Spanish regime. After 
              the independence of Morocco, they were confronted with a very strict 
              and repressive Moroccan regime and the departure of a lot of economic 
              and social capital. People of his generation felt they had to improve 
              the situation of Morocco, his people. This explains why so many 
              of his generation are very committed to the Moroccan cause. After 
              independence he became very active in youth movements, youth centres, 
              etc. These movements and centres were linked to political parties 
              and aimed at teaching and education the youth (raising awareness) 
              about political, social and syndical issues. From his secondary 
              school onward, he was involved in a student movement, striving for 
              democracy, freedom and against the repression of the royal regime. 
              He enacted his commitment to this issue via the labour union, he 
              didn't feel very politically connected. He also believed in changing 
              and improving the country through the education of children, so 
              he decided to become a teacher. He had a lot of frictions with the 
              regime, refused his army service and found it safer to emigrate 
              to Europe. He came to Belgium where he married a Belgian woman.</p>
            <p class="quote">In Belgium he dedicated a lot of his time to the 
              Moroccan cause, to the revolution against the repressive regime, 
              still thinking he would return. When the Belgian government installed 
              a migration stop in '74 it became clear that it was useless to think 
              he would return and to invest in Morocco. He then involved himself 
              in an Arabic department of the Catholic labour union. When he left 
              the ACV, because of disagreements, he left the migration theme and 
              got involved into international development cooperation and tried 
              to find money for Moroccan projects.</p>
