      <p><b>Sara from Belgium</b></p>
      <p>Sara is also an example of a person who is active in more than one domain 
        of life. Here too you can look for instances where she moves from one 
        domain to another, and one kind of activity to another, and try to identify 
        the factors contributing to this process.</p>

            <p class="quote">Sara grew up with her grandparents, who held socialist 
              values. She has been involved in the Socialist Party but today she 
              feels that she is more connected with the Green Party. </p>
            <p class="quote">Sara studied ‘Social Development and Pedagogy’ in 
              Brussels. During that time she also followed a number of courses 
              at a non-formal adult education institution associated with culture 
              and philosophy. These learning experiences have played an important 
              role in her becoming an active citizen. </p>
            <p class="quote">Professionally, Sara has been very committed to societal 
              problems; she worked in a Youth Information Centre, a Health Care 
              Organisation and the ‘Massereelfonds’ (a progressive cultural foundation). 
              For Sara, work was a way of being involved as an active citizen. 
              She gained a sense of agency and acquired skills that she was able 
              to use later in other settings.</p>
            <p class="quote">She was also involved actively with the Flemish Action 
              Committee against Nuclear Weapons (in short, VAKA), organising, 
              demonstrating and carrying out various activities. While studying 
              at university, she also invested lot of her time as a volunteer 
              adult literacy tutor. Another active commitment was with a women’s 
              group against rape (‘Tegen haar wil’), to ensure a respectful treatment 
              of rape victims. She was one of the cofounders of this group. They 
              ran a telephone helpline, and maintained links with women's refuge, 
              and referred women to social workers and other institutions. Sara 
              is also active in the parents' committee of her children's school 
              and the neighbourhood committee. She and a few others have done 
              door-to-door research about rebuilding their street and neighbourhood, 
              and organised meetings with local municipality to discuss the problems. 
              Other important issues that she has taken on board include inequality 
              in the world (striving for some kind of wealth tax/tobin tax) and 
              the rising extremist right wing successes in elections in Belgium. 
              She has organised and taken part in demonstrations and signing petitions 
              to address these issues.</p>
            <p class="quote">Sara has always taken social responsibility very 
              personally. When she is no longer able to demonstrate such personal 
              engagement, she searched for other domains and ways to be socially 
              committed. For example, she stopped her engagement with the rape-victim 
              centre because she didn’t feel qualified to cope with the heavy 
              problems she was confronted with and to really help the women. Later 
              she shut down the alternative café she started to organise because 
              it was too time consuming. She quit her work in a socio-cultural 
              association because she felt empty and burned out after eight years.
