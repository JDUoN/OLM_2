      <h1> Overview</h1>
      <p><b>What are Active Citizenship and Governance?</b></p>
      <p>What do we mean by <i>active citizenship</i>? And ... what do we mean 
        by <i>governance</i>? Are you an active citizen? Are you involved in governance? 
        Are there any common features which shape active citizenship and governance? 
        Do different people agree about what these words mean? These are the issues 
        we are going to explore in this section.</p>
      <p>Perhaps we all can agree that words such as active citizenship and governance 
        are difficult to define. As an active citizen, or an educator who is working 
        with active citizens, you may have come across many people who seem to 
        be active citizens, and many people who are involved in governance in 
        some ways. </p>
      <p>Let's pause for a couple of minutes ...</p>
      <table width="98%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="8" bgcolor="#CC9966">
        <tr align="left" valign="top"> 
          <td bgcolor="#FFCC99" align="center" width="10%"> 
            <p class="quote"><b>Reflection</b> <br />

          <td valign="middle" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="90%"> 
            <p class="quote"><b>Take about 2 minutes to think about the kinds 
              of people you work with. What do they do? </b><b>Do you consider 
              what they do is active citizenship? Are they involved in governance? 
              </b></p>
            <p class="quote"><b>Make a note of your reflections, and jot down 
              a few key words that come to your mind</b>.</p>
            <p class="quote"><b>When you have made notes about this, post these 
              on the Discussion Forum and compare them with what your fellow participants 
              have noted. </b><b>We will come back to your and your fellow participants'

      <p>Learning about other active citizens and reading about what they do can 
        be a helpful way to understand the diversity of active citizenship in 
        our society, both within particular countries and across Europe.</p>
      <p>The rest of the learning material contains stories of active citizens. 
        These stories have been categorised as '<b>short stories</b>' that illustrate 
        different forms of active citizenship, and '<b>descriptive stories</b>' 
        providing more insight into particular aspects of the active citizenship 
        of some individuals. While reading these stories you are encouraged to 
        give some thought to the diversity of active citizenship and governance 
        in terms of different themes and issues that matter to people, different 
        levels and contexts in which people engage in active citizenship and the 
        reasons for becoming active.</p>
      <p>Happy reading!</p>
