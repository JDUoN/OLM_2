            <p class="quote"><b>Kirsi</b> is the eldest of a family of three children. 
              Her mother was a kindergarten teacher and her father was a proofreader. 
              Politically, they were centre-left. Kirsi had a happy childhood. 
              She remembers, 'the summer cottage', trips in the wild, 'yachting 
              trips', 'Finnish Archipelago', etc. Her family had rabbits, guinea 
              pigs and a dog. From childhood, she learned to respect other human 
              beings and nature. </p>
            <p class="quote">As a teenager she was influenced by Animalia -association, 
              which distributed information on animal experiments and whaling. 
              She became a vegetarian. She also participated in environmental 
              campaigns and protests against whaling in Norway. In the upper secondary 
              school she learned about Greenpeace but did not have the possibility 
              of influencing in this professionally operated organisation. Influenced 
              by her biology teacher, Kirsi studied subjects related to the environment. 
            </p>
            <p class="quote">At university Kirsi moved to a small commune near 
              her home. She had met the other residents in the national Amnesty 
              organisation. Through visits to other universities she became interested 
              in the rights of sami-people. She realised that all citizens of 
              Finland are not equal. Her insight into Finnish society and its 
              exercise of power became deeper. She also had a feeling of being 
              in opposition with her opinions. </p>
            <p class="quote">In Northern-Finland she also familiarised herself 
              with Metsä-ryhmä of Luonto-Liitto (the Forest group of the Finnish 
              Nature League). Through practical engagement, she learned how to 
              influence: she participated in many kinds of activities from obstructing 
              logging to organising a forest conservation congress. Thus, many 
              efforts of Metsä-ryhmä included more or less illegal activities. 
              Kirsi received fines for civil disobedience. </p>
            <p class="quote">In Metsä-ryhmä Kirsi got to know many people, including 
              her husband. They married and moved to Joensuu in 1999. Kirsi's 
              master thesis was accepted in 2000 with the highest score within 
              a Finnish university system. In the beginning of 2001, she was considering 
              a career as a researcher. She was not sure if she could influence 
              enough through her job as an environmental educator. She is still 
              committed with Luonto-Liitto and led its local environmental group 
              for young persons. She also emphasised that Metsä-ryhmä would be 
              an important spiritual context for her in the future too. </p>
