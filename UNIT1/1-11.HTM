      <p><b>Ana from Slovenia</b></p>
      <p>Ana's story shows how a particular context produces a certain type of 
        active citizenship. She was involved in typical traditional politics during 
        the period when Slovenia underwent a transition towards democracy.</p>

            <p class="quote">Ana lives in a small town in the countryside of Slovenia, 
              where she was born and grew up. Her parents are government servants. 
              She has two young children.</p>
            <p class="quote">Ana is among the key people in a regional branch 
              of one of the political parties newly established in the transition 
              from socialist to democratic system. She has been an elected MP 
              from 1996 - 2000. </p>
            <p class="quote">As a student Ana participated in various cultural 
              groups and events in her local community. But she was never interested 
              either in political activities or in any other organised group activities 
              in the public sphere, not even the Students' Union. When transition 
              processes took place, she had just finished her studies and began 
              to work. </p>
            <p class="quote">Ana took over a part of the firm where she was working, 
              thanks to the economic and organisational restructuring of firms 
              and enterprises. As a young entrepreneur she began to be interested 
              in social and economic changes taking place in Slovenia. She felt 
              that there were some changes going on in different parts of Slovenia 
              while in the region where she lived no changes were likely to occur. 
              Her particular concern was strong centralisation which did not make 
              it possible for peripheral parts of Slovenia to develop. Preservation 
              of cultural heritage and tradition and the development of the rural 
              parts of Slovenia were also her interest. She was realistic that 
              complaining to friends did not make any difference. She says:: </p>

                    this political activity and this constant presence of the 
                    same people, started to bother me. To me it seemed as if things 
                    in L., or in any other place, went forward, here they stayed 
                    the same, connected to the same people, as if they were asleep. 
                    And I said to myself, '<i>well, yeah, there needs to be some 
                    change here</i>'. But you can only change something if you 
                    yourself are active in… All these things happening in the 
                    pubs are not productive, are they?</b></p>

            <p class="quote">Since her goals and expectations were similar to 
              those of one of the newly established political parties she accepted 
              the invitation of her friends to join the party. Shortly after becoming 
              a member she also ran for more responsible positions in the party. 
              Political activities took most of her time, and she decided to give 
              up her work as an entrepreneur. </p>
            <p class="quote">In 1996-2000 she was elected an MP. As an MP she 
              co-ordinated some projects in her region launched by the government 
              which aimed for the economic restructuring of the region. She was 
              also a chairman of the parliamentary commission on equal opportunities 
              which dealt with various social policy issues. She used her position 
              as an MP and a member of the political party which was in the government 
              coalition to pursue some issues concerning gender inequalities. 
              She was especially active in a group which was preparing new measures 
              to enable women to get access to political positions, although at 
              the end the new proposal was not passed by the parliament. Moreover, 
              she was involved in some parliamentary activities to raise awareness 
              about, and to bring in new measures to prevent, the sexual abuse 
              of women.</p>
