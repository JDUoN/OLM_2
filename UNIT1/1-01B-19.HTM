            <p class="quote"><b>Godfrey</b> is a retired development economist. 
              He was born and raised in Argentina and came to England when he 
              was 18 years old in order to see the world. He worked his way through 
              universities and gained degrees in development economics. He lived 
              and worked for international organisations in Zimbabwe, Zambia, 
              Ethiopia and Chile, then in the UK for the Ministry of Overseas 
              Development. He is the chairman of Age Concern in Guildford and 
              has been a local councillor for 9 years. Prior to that he was chairman 
              of the Guildford Society which is devoted to the protection of Guildford. 
              He made the Society effective by bringing together well-qualified 
              local people to challenge the Council on several issues. He fought 
              elections three times before winning and thought he would be more 
              effective as a politician than as an environmental campaigner. He 
              derives satisfaction in being able to get things done and has introduced 
              reforms. He says 'things are changing so someone must be changing 
              them so why shouldn't it be me'.</p>
