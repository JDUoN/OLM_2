            <p class="quote"><b>Dolores</b> has been working in the cloth manufacturing 
              sector for a long time. For the last three years she has been teaching 
              at a vocational training institute for women. While working as a 
              teacher, she also started to pursue university studies, in Social 
              Education, in order to acquire more knowledge about education and 
              to improve herself in her job. Her studies increased her motivation 
              to occupy herself with the problems many people face regarding their 
              integration in the labour market, especially in the case of immigrants. 
              Furthermore, she explains that she herself experienced being an 
              immigrant in a foreign country, as she lived in London before Spain 
              was part of the EU. She says this feeling motivated her to help 
              immigrants to gain equal opportunities for education and employment. 
              Currently she is unemployed and looking for a job. Because of this 
              situation, with more free time available, her intention of doing 
              something for her community has increased her disposition to do 
              some voluntary work in socio-cultural organisations. </p>
