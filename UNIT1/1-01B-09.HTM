            <p class="quote"><b>Ottelien</b> was born to a Catholic family with 
              six sisters and one brother. As a daughter she has a strict upbringing 
              and protected childhood. All the children have to work in their 
              father's smithy and their mother's grocers shop. After primary school 
              with the nuns, her mother sends her to a boarding school in a big 
              city in the south, where she gets her degree as a primary teacher. 
              At the age of 18, she decides, against the will of her parents, 
              to enter an order. Living in the nunnery, she worked for 30 years 
              in nursery schools, the last 16 years as the head of a nursery school. 
              But because of the re-organisation of these schools, leading to 
              a more individualised education of young children, at the age of 
              53 she quits her job. She becomes the personal housekeeper of a 
              priest for more than ten years. She is, so to say, a jack of all 
              trades. After her retirement, once a week she works at a public 
              centre where people can come and tell their stories. She listens 
              and sometimes she also gives advice. Also, she has started a course 
              to learn English and she likes to express herself pottery.</p>
