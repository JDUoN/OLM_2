            <p class="quote"><b>Gerda</b> was raised in a Christian tradition, 
              and a Catholic school. Her parents were always very conscious about 
              the environment and participated in an environmental organisation. 
              Gerda and her sister both participated in the youth department of 
              that organisation. One could say that they were really socialised 
              in environmental consciousness. She went to university to study 
              agricultural engineering from the same orientation. Also the 'third 
              world' is one of the themes she was interested in and concerned 
              about. She went to Rwanda for a year and a half under an international 
              development project, but wondered if that experience was not more 
              to her benefit than it has been for Rwanda itself. A lot of her 
              engagements or links with certain organisations happened through 
              knowing people. This was the case for her commitment in a 'foodteam' 
              (voedselteams), in an 'ecoteam', in the Green Party (Agalev), etc. 
              Within her professional career, she chose jobs that are in line 
              with her major interest, namely the environment. One can say that 
              she tries to enact her commitment via her job. Her individual lifestyle 
              represents her main interests.</p>
