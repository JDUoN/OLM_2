            <p class="quote"> <b>Wim</b> grew up in a Flemish Nationalistic family. 
              Failure in school led to an experience of being adrift. He found 
              a job in the army, where he appreciated the contacts with men from 
              different regions and the cultural differences. He valued communication, 
              and resented the aggressive approach to other people some of his 
              fellow soldiers take. When immigration became an issue in national 
              politics, he voted for the right wing nationalistic party to express 
              his discontent with the democratic parties who took no stand on 
              the matter. At the same time, (because of…), his political convictions 
              shifted from right to left. He left the army and attained his secondary 
              school diploma. He traveled to Guatemala and Tanzania, where he 
              became aware of the injustice of the western life style. He got 
              involved with Oxfam world trade, Greenpeace and similar organisations. 
              He studied Educational sciences at university; he was interested 
              in a method of education that respects the individuality of each 
              child (against the levelling tendencies of traditional social institutions) 
              and that fosters all dimensions of life (holism). He took up teaching 
              at a school based upon the philosophy of Rudolf Steiner, and remains 
              active in various organisations. </p>
