      <p class="quote"><b>Martha</b> is a civil servant. She became a local politician 
        in 1998. Since childhood she has been interested in political affairs. 
        Her political and social consciousness was strengthened by her family 
        circumstances. Her mother became ill with Multiple Sclerosis when she 
        was ten years old. The family income was too high to qualify for social 
        services help so she and her sister became carers for their mother. This 
        had a big impact on her, forced her to become independent at an early 
        age and to be ready to fight for things.</p>
      <p class="quote">After her marriage broke up she became involved in politics, 
        as she needed to do 'something'. She is angered by people who do not vote 
        and do not believe that in a democracy they have power to change things. 
        She likes being able to get things done. </p>
