            <p class="quote"><b>Bas</b> grew up in the northern part of the Netherlands. 
              His parents divorced when he was twelve. He completed his education 
              as a social worker, but, as he says, could not avoid his creativity 
              and subsequently decided to follow a higher vocational education 
              in visual arts. For two years now he has been trying to make a living 
              through building "installations". He lives with his friend in a 
              caravan camp. He is active in the anarchistic movement and tries 
              to integrate this engagement in his creative work. Apart from his 
              creative work in the strict sense, he helps to produce a periodical 
              and occasionally also posters for demonstrations for the movement. 
              His main topic is the evil of globalization and the dominance of 
              the economy in general. He was also an active member of the board 
              of the caravan camp.</p>
