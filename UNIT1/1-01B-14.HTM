            <p class="quote"><b>Leo's </b>father was a farmer and mother was a 
              trainee agriculturist. The parents worked assiduously and saved 
              up for a house. They moved when Leo was about 7 years old. Leo described 
              the set of values of the family by saying that for economic reasons 
              his parents preferred to give up buying milk rather than to resign 
              from the book club. The economic situation of the family improved 
              when the father succeeded as an entrepreneur. The social respect 
              of the family increased especially, because his father bought a 
              large forest tract in the middle of the best deer-stalking area.</p>
            <p class="quote">The locals were wondering about the son of a farmhand 
              who succeeded in a school without reading. In the school he was 
              bullied and developed anorexia in the summer just before the upper 
              level of comprehensive school. He went to the upper secondary school 
              of Kotka lyceum mostly because his best friends also went there. 
              It was there, where Leo became interested in information technology. 
              After secondary school graduation he entered the Faculty of Electrical 
              and Communications Engineering at a university. However, he did 
              not feel at home in this faculty and transferred to the faculty 
              of Industrial Management and started to study industrial psychology. 
              According to him: "humans seemed much more interesting and complex 
              subjects to program than computers". The decision paid off and Leo 
              got his master's thesis in 1995.</p>
            <p class="quote">Leo told his life story as a human, as a writer, 
              as a politician and as a researcher. As a human: he fell in love 
              in a confirmation class, he became engaged to his childhood friend 
              in 1980 when the couple were entering to upper secondary school 
              and he married his fiancée in 1989. The first child was born in 
              1994. </p>
            <p class="quote">Leo has always expressed himself through writing. 
              He wrote fairy tales as early as pre-school. Writing was his favourite 
              subject in school too. The first published stories appeared during 
              the period of the upper secondary school. The first story was published 
              in the local paper, Kotkansilmä. It described how Leo's class had 
              organised the fund-raising for development aid. Another published 
              article in the Prosessori -journal was concerned with programming 
              a computer game. Later he has written dozens of articles and books 
              about home computers. He has also published a couple of science 
              fiction short stories and a radio programme series. In addition, 
              he had spent a couple of years as the editor-in-chief of Kosmoskynä, 
              the journal of the Finnish Science Fiction Writers' Association.

            <p class="quote">Leo entered politics in late 1994, as his conscience 
              did not allow him to continue complaining without offering an alternative. 
              This alternative presented itself as a new party, the Young Finns 
              Party. He collected 5000 names in order to establish a new political 
              party. He also took part in the 1995 parliamentary election and 
              carried out his election campaign on the Internet. In the 1996 double 
              election his 1185 votes were not enough to get him to the EU-parliament, 
              but he succeeded in the council election and become a councillor 
              and a member of the city board too. In the 1999 parliamentary elections 
              no candidates of the Young Finns Party were elected to the parliament 
              and its members decided to dismantle the whole party. After that 
              Leo found a new political home in the Green League. In the year 
              2000 municipal elections he became re-elected to the city council 
              from the Green League list.</p>
            <p class="quote">Leo never left his old university and he has been 
              working in the Laboratory of Industrial Psychology and Leadership 
              since 1990, first as a research assistant, then as a researcher. 
              In 1995 he started working on his postgraduate studies. His studies 
              have been connected with electronic performance support systems 
              in learning organizations. He participates in public discussions 
              in the role of researcher too. Parallelly, the work gives him tools 
              for influencing. He likes his job but is not planning to retire 
              as a researcher.</p>
