            <p class="quote"><b>Ronald</b> was born into a rather military-loving 
              family with a dominant father. Fulfilling his military service, 
              he is selected for training as an officer. However, his friends 
              are more left wing oriented and he decides to complete his draft 
              as an ordinary soldier, joining an interest group for conscientious 
              objectors. At a rather young age, he starts a family and devotes 
              himself to a study of French Language and Literature. </p>
            <p class="quote">Watching the television one evening back in 1974, 
              his attention is drawn to the possibility of nuclear fusion as an 
              energy source. Interested, he decides to go to what is supposed 
              to be a peaceful demonstration in Germany. He gets alarmed when 
              he is not allowed to cross the border and becomes extremely active 
              in the movement against nuclear energy. This movement is very successful 
              in the Netherlands, raising a wave of protests among old and young, 
              ultimately forcing the government to abandon their plans. After 
              this period of him being a central figure in the fight against nuclear 
              energy, he becomes the director of a non-profit organisation for 
              responsible scientific research, a position he leaves a few years 
              later for a management position in higher education. He is active 
              in local media and an organisation that facilitates young musicians. 
              He finds his goal in life to be contributing to societal development.</p>
