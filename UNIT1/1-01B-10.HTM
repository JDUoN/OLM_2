            <p class="quote"><b>Majda</b> comes from a middle class family, her 
              father was in an independent profession. The life style of her family 
              was not quite in line with social expectations. Because of personal 
              reasons she could not become a doctor - paediatrician so she chose 
              to study economy. Although she was a good student she left after 
              two years, as she did not like the profession. She continued at 
              the College for social workers. While she was on practical training 
              in an agency for socially disturbed children she "fell in love" 
              with that kind of work and juvenile delinquency became her first 
              work area. Later she extended the work also to drug addiction and 
              to some other kinds of social problems of young people. She was 
              among those who promoted new modern methods of dealing with social 
              problems. During her work she changed three employment organisations 
              because she always looked for new challenges. She launched some 
              important projects aimed at improving social conditions of certain 
              marginalised groups, among them voluntary counselling to prisoners 
              and a victim support counselling. Now she is retired but she is 
              still very active in both projects. Her priority is supervision 
              in the field of social security. </p>
