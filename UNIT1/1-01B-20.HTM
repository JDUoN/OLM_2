            <p class="quote"><b>Pekka</b> was born in 1946 in Vaasa. The family 
              was a petty bourgeois civil servant family. His father worked as 
              a municipal secretary and was later promoted as a municipal manager. 
              Pekka had four siblings: two older brothers, a younger sister and 
              a younger brother. Their upbringing was quite free. However, schooling 
              was seen as important and it was encouraged. The family was not 
              religious, and the meaning of money was not over-emphasised. In 
              contrast to the more or less bourgeois values of his parents Pekka 
              later adopted a left wing world view. </p>
            <p class="quote"> In his early teenage Pekka walked in nature, liked 
              sports, tried 4-H -club and participated in activities in the Scout 
              Association. He especially enjoyed scout activities and attended 
              meetings and camps quite regularly from 10 to 14 years old. </p>
            <p class="quote">Pekka had confrontations with his teachers, and he 
              was kept in detention after the school. He dropped out of grammar 
              school and moved to Helsinki at 17. He had no vocational education 
              and he had to do different odd jobs. In military service he tried 
              to resist bullying by referring to the rulebook, but did not succeed. 
            </p>
            <p class="quote">After military service he trained himself as a plumber. 
              He got married in 1968 and divorced after four years. He became 
              a single parent for his daughter. In 1972 he was chosen as a shop 
              steward of his work place. He started to study labour laws and regulations 
              by himself. In addition to that, he became interested in the literature 
              of social criticism. He was impressed, especially, by the works 
              of Marx. In 1970s he was involved in the youth organisation of the 
              Finnish communist party.</p>
            <p class="quote">His employer tried to discriminate against him, and 
              after a legal struggle in 1976-1977, he was able to hold down his 
              job. In 1980-1981 he spent a year in Moscow studying philosophy 
              and national/political economics. In the beginning of the 1980s 
              he also participated in the activities of Rauhanpuolustajat (guardians 
              of peace) organisation. </p>
            <p class="quote">Later, he experienced a kind of crisis when the Soviet 
              Union collapsed. Parallelly, an important reference group, the Finnish 
              communist party broke out. In 1992 he became unemployed when his 
              employer went bankrupt. During the same year he travelled to Latin 
              America: Nicaragua, Mexico and Cuba.</p>
            <p class="quote">Pekka joined in establishing an organisation for 
              unemployed people of Helsinki in 1993. He became its chairperson. 
              In the beginning of 2001, when the second interview was done, he 
              worked as an executive manager of the association. During the 1990s 
              he has participated in organising many kinds of demonstrations and 
              campaigns. The greatest of them was called Murrostorstai (Thursday 
              of radical change) in 1993. There were over 10 000 people demonstrating 
              against unemployment. </p>
