        The word 'Alkuvoima' literally means <i>Primal Force</i>. Alkuvoima tells

        society' and 'work'.</b></p>

            <p class="quote"><i>Alkuvoima </i>has been established by a group 
              of young farmers such as Anja (who tells this story) in order to 
              fight the injustice they faced in their work. The young farmers 
              in her community felt that they were treated unjustly by the established 
              structures such as The Central Union of Agricultural Producers and 
              Forest Owners (in short, MTK) and by the Finnish media. They took 
              proactive action, and formed an activity group to improve the image 
              of farmers and other country people. Anja explains more:</p>

                    of circle of friends was born in this activity, we established 
                    Alkuvoima (Primal force) activity group. It started because 
                    we young (farmers) never succeeded in achieving positions 
                    of influence (in MTK). Our way to act was too visible, critical 
                    and radical. So, they did not at once have courage to trust 
                    us. For this reason, we decided, that it is all right. We 
                    can act by ourselves too. Finland was then going to join the 
                    European Union - a very pointed antagonism between countryside 
                    and city. There were young women in the same situation. They 
                    had also experienced the loneliness of mother of being a young 
                    children, and they had also experienced the lack of 'soul 
                    mates' in the neighbourhood. Then men started to join our 
                    group too. We created it as an informal group, and it became 
                    very quickly a kind of study circle, we supported each other, 
                    and it became also a demonstration group capable of reacting 
                    very fast.</b></p>

            <p class="quote">Alkuvoima was born in 1993 among young and young-at 
              heart farmers in South-East-Finland. The aim of the group is to 
              maintain the Finnish countryside as a viable and enjoyable environment. 
              Parallelly, the aim is to improve the image and position of 'farmer 
              sisters and brothers'. Alkuvoima has about 40 members, mostly young 
              farmers, but not only: the professions vary from a baker to a diplomat, 
              a school headmaster to a university scientist. There is no age limit 
              and both women and men are welcome. However, there is a nucleus 
              of seven women who have run most of the activities of the group. 
            </p>
            <p class="quote">Alkuvoima has no formal organisational hierarchy, 
              but the naturally grown nucleus of seven women has run most of the 
              activities. According to Anja, one of the wonderful features of 
              the group is that the women feel that they are whole-heartedly encouraged 
              in their activities by the men. </p>
            <p class="quote">Another important feature of the group has been that 
              instead of writing meeting protocols and using energy in other less 
              productive activities, the group has worked to change the world 
              by letting people know how young farmers saw the situation in the 
              country. The group has written press notices, arranged street campaigns 
              and manifestations, met political decision-makers and contacted 
              different organisations. Anja also describes how the study circle 
              oriented itself to Europe. </p>
            <p class="quote">The group has also studied how the European Union 
              is functioning. In this learning process networking has played an 
              important role:</p>

                    we want to correspond with colleagues. And perhaps they can 
                    send us some material'. The consequence was that we received 
                    over a hundred answers. We sent our advertisements to England, 
                    Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Belgium, France, Germany and Austria, 
                    to eight journals. It was not part of the policy of every

                    in England, in Scotland and in Germany they published. And 
                    from Austria they sent us journals, and from Germany they
