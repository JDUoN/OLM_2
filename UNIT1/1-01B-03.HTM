            <p class="quote"><b>Laila</b> has a Dutch mother and a Moluccan father. 
              She was born in the Netherlands and raised in a Moluccan environment 
              with strict Moluccan norms and values. After primary school she 
              went to grammar school. Because of her activities for the Moluccan 
              and Dutch society, she neglected her schoolwork. She enjoyed organising 
              activities for youth, such as dancing clubs, camps and homework 
              supervision groups. It took her a long time to get her diploma. 
            </p>
            <p class="quote">Laila's family has been supportive of her activities. 
              Her father and grandfather are role models for her. She is very 
              active in politics, where she fights for the rights and independence 
              of the Moluccan people. Also she invests a lot of time and energy 
              in her activities for the Moluccan church, where she finds her inner 
              peace. She calls herself a late-developer. She has always been helping 
              others, completely neglecting herself. She thinks she is an active 
              citizen, because she can hardly say 'no'.</p>
