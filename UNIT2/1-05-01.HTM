            <p class="quote">Throughout the last decade, Ursa has faced a number 
              of new challenges to which she had to react promptly and accurately. 
              Although she has a strong professional background, she had to upgrade 
              her knowledge from available literature and practice very quickly. 
              To support her learning, she gained a number of friends with different 
              backgrounds and from different countries who supported her with 
              their knowledge and advice. Sharing information and knowledge with 
              others in similar fields created a personal network. In this way, 
              she created an atmosphere in which friendship, partnerships and 
              networks could exist and develop.</p>
            <p class="quote">On several occasions, Slovenian political parties 
              tried to draw Ursa and the Association for Prevention under their 
              influence. She rejected patronage both from political parties and 
              the state. She sees political independence for NGOs and civil society 
              initiatives as a matter of principle. In her view, political parties 
              do not have clear enough political profiles in the 'transition states'. 
              Therefore, she tried to have political impact through links with 
              other national, regional and international NGOs and institutions. 
              Links at the national level proved the most difficult. There is 
              no doubt that the transition in Slovenia was a period of rapid change 
              and fast learning for Ursa. As she said, she was faced with many 
              injustices and much opportunistic behaviour, but also she came across 
              much positive, humane action, solidarity and many exceptional people.</p>
