            <p class="quote">Mandy is a factory worker in the north of England. 
              She is nearly 40 at the time we met her. Having left school at 16 
              without many academic qualifications she started working as a shop 
              assistant. Her trade union activities began when she went to work 
              in a factory. She was not happy that her trade union was not concerned 
              about the welfare of the younger workers. She therefore decided 
              to become a shop steward in order to change the culture of the trade 
              union. In the process she learned from the courses offered by the 
              trade union. Now she is a senior shop steward. Also she works as 
              an occasional tutor for the trade union. Currently she is enrolled 
              for a Masters degree in industrial relations.</p>
            <p class="quote">Mandy described herself as a bit of a rebel at school 
              and, as she grew older, 'a rebel without a cause' until she became 
              involved in the trade union. She saw herself as having a strong 
              personality and always trying to lead or organise. Her working class 
              community background also gave her some values associated with working 
              together, of people helping each other. So, she said she had a strong 
              sense of 'wanting to belong' and 'encouraging people to help each 
              other'. The union's resistance to change and lack of interest in 
              young people gave her a cause to fight for - something she wanted 
              to change. But Mandy also liked challenges. She regarded it as a 
              personal challenge to get 'this old established culture' to change. 
            </p>
            <p class="quote">Another feature of her character was that she wanted 
              'to be stimulated' and wanted 'to achieve.' The trade union courses 
              and its activities gave her a chance to 'get my brain stimulated' 
              and she was keen to do her elected job of shop steward well: 'I 
              am quite inquisitive and if I do something I like to know I am doing 
              it properly … I wanted to be a good shop steward [and also] to better 
              myself'. This combination of personal ambition and desire to achieve 
              enabled Mandy to overcome any resistance or antagonisms towards 
              her appointment or goals. She said 'she never felt intimidated' 
              but alongside that her confidence grew as she gained more knowledge 
              and skills through the courses on offer.</p>
            <p class="quote">So for Mandy being an active citizen was about having 
              a sense that she was growing as a person, but also having a conviction 
              that she was able to influence something that directly affected 
              her and people like her. For instance, she started to get involved 
              in courses for women once she had a child because she began to realise 
              the difficulties women have in trying to develop themselves with 
              no child support. She needed a shared identity with the cause and 
              she had a personality that enabled her to get involved and achieve 
              something effectively: 'I believe people should be treated with 
              dignity and respect.' Her trade union work enabled her to 'make 
              sure people are treated right'. </p>
            <p class="quote">This active citizen was energetic and had strong 
              beliefs about the rights of her fellow human beings.</p>
