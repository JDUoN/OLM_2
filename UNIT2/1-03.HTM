            <p class="quote">Peter grew up on a farm. He did not want to become 
              a farmer himself; instead he took up a job in a social institution 
              that caters for youngsters with problems. </p>
            <p class="quote">Peter was confronted with a range of experiences 
              while working in this institution that contributed to his taking 
              an active role, and becoming an active citizen. He became aware 
              of how people are being treated unjustly. Improving other people's 
              lives became his personal goal and ambition. His work with these 
              youngsters made him aware of how difficult it is for them to find 
              a position in society. Peter says:</p>

                    me, that there is so much misery in so many families. Even 
                    in the families of which you would least expect it. That was 
                    my first confrontation.</b></p>

            <p class="quote">After a while Peter got tired of his job because 
              of the rigidity of its structure. He felt that the decision making 
              processes in the organisation were very slow and against his sense 
              of autonomy.</p>
            <p class="quote">In the end, he went back to his father's farm and 
              took responsibility for running it. There were other reasons for 
              going back to his father's farm. He felt that certain things he 
              enjoyed as a child growing up on a rural farm were being threatened 
              and he wanted to defend those values he nurtured and grew up with. 
              In addition, he did not agree how the media reported farming in 
              the national press. There were also scandals related to farming. 
              All these factors led him to take over the farm (remember, in the 
              beginning he didn't want to have anything to do with farming!).</p>
            <p class="quote">Peter wanted to give urban people a sense of farming 
              as a way of life. He invited people from urban areas to get to know 
              and value farming. As you can see, Peter felt challenged and wanted 
              to take up a responsibility for a social commitment. After taking 
              over his parents' farm, he converted some of it to include facilities 
              for tourists. This was his way of making people (especially urban) 
              aware of nature and the positive aspects of farming. </p>
            <p class="quote">You'll remember that Peter was involved with a social 
              organisation dealing with young people with problems, and that he 
              left that organisation since he did not feel comfortable with it. 
              Through the farm venture, Peter tried to combine both ambitions: 
              farming and social work. Now he helps socially disadvantaged groups 
              to acquire a job. </p>
