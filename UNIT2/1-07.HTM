        Active Citizens - the diversity</h1>
      <p>So who are active citizens? You have read stories of six active citizens 
        from different countries in Europe. What do your notes say? What were 
        your reflections based on the discussions that you have had with the fellow 
        participants in the discussion forum? Below are our own thoughts, which 
        you might later want to challenge based on your own analysis.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We can say that active citizens come from diverse backgrounds, in 
          terms of the social class, economic position, employment, age,gender, 
          sexuality, marital status, ethnicity, religion, skills level, etc. As 
          our British colleague Julia Preece says: 'People who were active citizens 
          ranged from retired professionals and middle class housewives, to unemployed 
          young people, trade unionists and people with academic or non academic 
          backgrounds. Active citizens were male or female, black or white.'<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> As seen in the stories you have read, and perhaps based on your experience, 
          we also can say that active citizens take a particular interest and 
          give personal commitment to the experiences and incidents they come 
          across, in their own lives and/or their loved ones, and in relation 
          to the wider society. They see the injustice, and make a personal commitment 
          to make changes. They are not passive and want to challenge the existing 
          authority. They have a critical awareness of society.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Active citizens, as we have seen in the stories, take different approaches 
          to make these changes. Some try to do this through the existing mechanisms 
          and structures, and by joining organisations that are already in place. 
          Some of them realise that the existing mechanisms are not the answer, 
          so they innovate new structures.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>What roles do the active citizens play? In what capacities do they 
          work? There is a variety, as you have seen in the stories, and some 
          of them show the capacity to act in different roles: educators, organisers, 
          fund-raisers, councillors, politicians, innovators, founders, change 
          agents, etc.</li>
