              had a big influence on her early aspirations to become an artist. 
              When she was ten years old her parents were divorced, which had

            <p class="quote">As a high school pupil, Ursa tried to initiate changes 
              in the grammar-school system, and got into conflict with one of 
              the teachers when she disagreed with a proposed solution, which 
              she thought was unjust. She dropped out, and moved to London without 
              her parents' consent. In London she took a job in a travel agency, 
              where she tried to improve the employees' working conditions, but 
              without success. She subsequently left the firm.</p>
            <p class="quote">Seven years later she moved back to Slovenia. Having 
              worked in various capacities, raising a child as a single mother, 
              learning about social work and NGO initiatives, she returned to 
              Slovenia as someone with much experience in life. Settling back 
              in Slovenia was a difficult time in her life. Although she took 
              various jobs, her income did not cover all her costs. A gesture 
              of solidarity came from an Italian friend, who collected money from 
              his friends to cover her bills, which strengthened Ursa's conviction 
              that solidarity among people is essential. </p>

                    actually knowing the person; and that solidarity among people 
                    exists, in spite of the fact that at that time we were very 
                    oriented towards the consumer society.</b></p>

            <p class="quote">Ursa started to work professionally as a social worker 
              in a Children's Hospital. She began to realise that families were 
              excluded from the treatment of their children. She therefore sought 
              new models of family treatment. Despite the rigid institutional 
              and professional barriers, she succeeded in introducing innovative 
              ideas; her methods helped parents to be with their children while 
              they were in hospital. In Slovenia before the transition to democracy, 
              changes in any sphere of life, even in the private domain, were 
              very difficult.</p>
            <p class="quote">At this time Ursa received a British Council grant 
              to visit Children's hospitals in Oxford and London in England. This 
              opportunity gave her the chance to explore Family Therapy techniques 
              and, as a result, she organised the first family seminar in Slovenia. 
              She also joined the new initiative Crisis Line where she worked 
              as a supervisor and team member. As a team member and researcher, 
              she participated actively in national projects and in international 
              conferences. Her papers focused on children, youth and family issues. 
              She was also a cofounder of the Association for the Prevention and 
              she created a network of youth mentors.</p>
            <p class="quote">Through her work in different public services, Ursa 
              promoted voluntary work as having special value for health and social 
              care. Cooperation with many students and volunteers made her realise 
              that civil initiatives need to be supported to be able to be transformed 
              into civil actions. Therefore she became the president of the Association 
              for Preventive and Voluntary Work with the main goal of supporting 
              civil initiatives and promoting voluntary work.</p>
            <p class="quote">The war in the Balkans took Ursa into the battlefront, 
              helping in the refugee crisis. </p>
            <p class="quote">When refugees fled, first from Croatia and then from 
              Bosnia, Ursa decided on a new direction: </p>

                    with such force that I surprised myself; and I said to myself, 
                    that this was enough, that I had to do something, that I can't 
                    be passive any more.</b></p>

            <p class="quote">In a matter of days, Ursa managed to gather a hundred 
              volunteers when the first refugees arrived. Her strong belief, that 
              each individual has the knowledge and skills needed to support civil 
              initiatives, guided her new activity. Projects in the camps included 
              cultural activities, sports activities, psycho-social support, legal 
              assistance, youth work, and so forth. Active participation of the 
              refugees became one of the most important aims. Ursa learned that 
              besides giving personal assistance to refugees, lobbying and advocacy 
              activities on the national and international level were very important. 
              In the period 1991-1995 she was also very active in peace initiatives 
              in the former Yugoslavia. </p>
