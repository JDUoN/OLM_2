            <p class="quote">Peter identifies with the farmers, but did not want 
              to join a farmers' organisation. He disliked the slowness of decision-making 
              in social organisations and therefore runs his own 'caring' farm. 
              Some people do not join an already existing organisation, but create 
              one of their own. The decision to create or innovate a certain organisation 
              or structure can be inspired by the fact that it offers opportunities 
              to pursue one's social concerns in a personal, individual way, leaving 
              a maximal amount of space for one's personal ambitions and sensitivities. 
              A strong sense of autonomy (combined with solidarity for others) 
              can be the motivating force behind active citizenship. Freedom of 
              thought, not being dependent on others or on social structures, 
              being true to oneself, being able to express one's opinion, and 
              resisting social pressure are different expressions of this motive.

            <p class="quote">By taking a job in a certain sector, people grow 
              familiar with the characteristics and the specific problems of this 
              domain. This can enable them to take responsibility for social issues 
              related to this sector. In this sense, work is mainly a source of 
              informal learning. Work can open up new perspectives and forms of 
              participation to people. Moreover it is in his job that Peter feels 
              connected with the youngsters and acquires the necessary competencies 
              to do something for them.</p>
