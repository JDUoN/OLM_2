            <p class="quote">Charlotte was born on the borders of the Waddenzee 
              (lowlands), where her grandparents had a farm and her father owned 
              greenhouses. Every week she used to take long walks on the beach 
              with her father. From these memories, and her father's character, 
              she developed a deep love of the Wadden. Charlotte's father was 
              the first organic farmer in the Netherlands. As a child, she had 
              to deal regularly with questions relating to the environment, healthy 
              food, and the natural world.</p>
            <p class="quote"> In order to go to secondary school, Charlotte had 
              to leave the countryside where she grew up. She joined a band of 
              hippies at the age of seventeen, and stayed at weekends with friends 
              in a squat, which was like a commune. It was on an old farm in the 
              country, and there the young student revolutionaries philosophised 
              about the world:</p>

                  <p class="quote"><b>In the early sixties there was a big difference 
                    between the city and the countryside. I was an exception at 
                    school. In 1966, a movement arose that expressed itself in 
                    long hair, smoking hashish and so on. Because I was an exception 
                    in that fashionable school anyway, I joined that movement.</b></p>

            <p class="quote"> After secondary school, Charlotte wanted to travel. 
              Her parents disagreed, but she was determined to see the world on 
              her own. She hitchhiked to London and Paris, where she wrote music 
              and poems. Later on she started to study at a school in Utrecht. 
              She never finished her study, because she ended up in Morocco with 
              a friend. At that time, she was broke and had to beg for money. 
              After three months of roaming, singing, and begging Charlotte finally 
              came back to her home town. She started to live in a commune again. 
              Later, at the age of twenty-one, she decided to go back to her parents 
              in order to get her degree at the Agricultural School. She finally 
              graduated in geography, and went back to live in the commune again.

            <p class="quote">Once back in Groningen, she finds out that her beloved 
              Waddenzee is in danger and she immediately joins a movement to preserve 
              this fragile nature reserve. She is very successful in her activities 
              and becomes a paid coordinator. Because of her direct and vigorous 
              approach, she gets a lot done, but her direct approach eventually 
              also leads to a conflict with her superiors, and she was dismissed 
              from her duties. Charlotte explains:</p>
