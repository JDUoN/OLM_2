            <p class="quote">Antonio has been working as a mechanic for a multinational 
              corporation for 31 years. During his working life, he had been developing 
              a range of activities as an independent trade unionist. His work 
              was 'illegal' at first under the dictatorship regime of Franco. 
              After Spain became a democracy, his work became legal.</p>
            <p class="quote">As one of his activities in the trade union, Antonio 
              and his fellow unionists and workers took industrial action asking 
              for a wage increase. For this activity, he and some of his co-workers 
              were fired from the company for three years. They however carried 
              on their activities during these three years. A judge finally ruled 
              in favour of them; as a result the company had to reinstate Antonio 
              and his colleagues in their jobs.</p>
            <p class="quote">For a time Antonio was also a town councillor in 
              the education department in his town (Ripollet, Barcelona) as a 
              member of a local independent coalition of social movements (COP). 
              Through their participation in local government, they aimed to increase 
              popular participation in local government. They campaigned for the 
              involvement of parents in the education of children in order to 
              improve the quality of education provision. Antonio however felt 
              that the Mayor and his team were not really interested in listening 
              to the demands of the parents and the public, and to boost the popular 
              participation in decision making process. This disillusion led him 
              (and two other COP councillors) to resign from their posts. </p>
            <p class="quote">Antonio is critical about the mainstream unions. 
              He has continued to be involved with other organisations within 
              COP (the Popular Workers' Collective). At the moment, for instance, 
              he is involved in an exchange programme between Ripollet workers 
              and Latin American workers concerning training questions. He has 
              not ceased to be committed to COP's activities because he believes 
              in the importance of personal relationships among equals as an alternative 
              to impersonal large organisations with a paternalist direction.
