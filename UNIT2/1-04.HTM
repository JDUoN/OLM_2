            <p class="quote">As a <i>human being</i> Jyrki says he fell in love 
              while he was at school! He was engaged to his childhood sweetheart 
              in 1980 when both of them entered to the upper secondary school. 
              He then married his fiancée in 1989. The first child was born in 
              1994.</p>
            <p class="quote">As a <i>scientist</i> Jyrki works at the Helsinki 
              University of Technology. His studies have been connected with electronic 
              performance support systems in learning organizations.</p>
            <p class="quote">As an <i>author</i> Jyrki has written dozens of articles 
              and books related to computers and the Internet. He has also written 
              a couple of science fiction short stories and a radio programme 
              series. In addition, he had spent a couple of years as the editor-in-chief 
              of Kosmoskynä, the journal of the Finnish Science Fiction Writers' 
              Association. </p>
            <p class="quote">Jyrki became a <i>politician </i>in late 1994. Rather 
              than complaining about things, he wanted to offer solutions to problems. 
              Moreover he wanted to offer an alternative solution to problems. 
              This alternative was realised as a new party, the Young Finns Party 
              (<i>Nuorsuomalainen puolue</i> - There are historical reasons for 
              the name and it was not aimed just for young people). He took part 
              in collecting 5000 signatures to establish a new political party, 
              and took part in the 1995 parliamentary election. He used the Internet 
              to carry out his election campaign. He claims that:</p>

            <p class="quote">This first Internet election campaign brought 403 
              votes, which were helping a party colleague of his to enter the 
              Finnish parliament. In the 1996 double election his 1185 votes were 
              not enough to get him to the EU-parliament, but he succeeded in 
              the city council election and became a councillor and a member of 
              the city board too. In the 1999 parliamentary elections no candidates 
              of the Young Finns Party were elected to the parliament and its 
              members decided to dismantle the party. After that Jyrki found a 
              new political home in the Green League. In the year 2000 municipal 
              elections he got re-elected to the city council from the Green League

                    enough on a level of council election, but not yet on a level 
                    of parliamentary election. Of course, much will happen on 
                    the Internet during the next three years. But unfortunately, 
                    from the viewpoint of voters it gives you credibility, when 
                    you sometimes have advertisements of 10 000 Finnish marks 
                    in newspapers. People somehow subconsciously feel that you 
                    are serious. From somewhere I should find that 20 000 Finnish 
                    marks. There have been, even in council election, 300 000 
                    Finnish marks campaigns. It always comes to mind a question 
                    over who has paid that 300 000 and why.</b></p>

              and a member of the city board. These pages include, of course, 
              some elements of self-congratulation but also serious discussions 
              with existing and potential voters about values, opinions and achievements 
              such as initiatives and decisions that he had made.</p>
