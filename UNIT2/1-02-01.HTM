            <p class="quote">From the Dutch life histories and from the expert 
              meetings in the Netherlands, we can conclude that the new active 
              citizen is seen as an adventurous type, not afraid to take risks. 
              He is less inclined to stay long with one organisation. In fact, 
              he is more faithful to a certain cause than to institutions or associations. 
              The new active citizen is independent, assertive, alert and (has 
              to) know how to deal with conflicts, with risks and with unexpected 
              situations. He is very communicative and able to process lots of 
              information. And finally, active citizens have relatively many and 
              rather often changing connections with other people; they live in 
              a diversity of networks. A very clear example in this scope is the 
              life history of Charlotte, who clearly shows an adventurous character.
