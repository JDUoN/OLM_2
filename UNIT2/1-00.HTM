      <p><b>Who are Active Citizens? </b></p>
      <p>An educator who is working with a large voluntary sector organisation 
        tried to answer this question. He began by saying that 'I wish I were 
        a firefighter! Then it would be easier for me to explain what I am doing 
        and who I am working with.' For him it was difficult to give a straightforward 
        answer, about who an active citizen is.</p>
      <p>Let's pause for a moment ... </p>

              your job is, or what you do as a voluntary activity, and your involvement 
              with active citizens. Your friend asks you 'Who is an active citizen?' 
              </b></p>
            <p class="quote"><b>What would your answer be? How would you describe 
              an active citizen? What kinds of words would you use?</b></p>

      <p>In this theme, we are going to explore this question and come up with 
        some criteria to describe and appreciate the diversity of active citizens. 
        We will consider the diverse backgrounds of active citizens and look at 
        the different experiences they undergo in becoming active citizens. We 
        will also look at the variety of roles they play as active citizens, and 
        try to understand any common characteristics (if there are any) that can 
        be found among active citizens.</p>

      <p>Learning about other active citizens will be a useful starting point 
        to understand the diversity of their backgrounds, their character, and 
        the different roles they play as active citizens. Therefore, this section 
        contains stories of a number of active citizens highlighting the diverse 
        nature of active citizens, some providing an in-depth insight into particular 
        aspects of active citizens. While reading these stories you are encouraged 
        to give some thought to this diversity.</p>
      <p>Happy reading!</p>
