      <h1 class="grape"> Beryl's story</h1>
      <p>Beryl was 56 at the time she told her story. She migrated to England 
        from Jamaica when she was 19. She faced many difficulties as a black, 
        single mother, without much prospect of a decent living. She however had 
        the courage and the determination to study.</p>
      <p>She trained to become a nurse, and went to the local college for night 
        classes. She became aware of the issues facing people like herself, and 
        started to work in the voluntary sector. At 40 she was diagnosed as having 
        cancer, and just as she was recovering, her son met with a serious accident. 
        Among other things, she founded a self-help organisation for women for 
        which she was recently awarded the first 'unsung women's award.' </p>
      <p>There are many factors that contributed to her becoming an active citizen, 
        which, for now, we categorised as follows. You can click on each of the 
        categories to read her experiences. </p>
