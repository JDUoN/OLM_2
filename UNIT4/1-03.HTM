      <h1 class="grape"> Learning to become an active citizen - some key points</h1>
      <p>In Theme 4 we attempted to explore the main question of how people learn 
        to become active citizens. In particular we wanted to look at the nature 
        and the main features of the learning process, and the factors that contribute 
        to it. And finally we want to see what we can do, as active citizens, 
        educators, and facilitators, to strengthen this learning process.</p>
      <p>These are difficult questions; we know the difficulty of making generalisations 
        about the learning process or the factors that contribute to the learning 
        process. The life stories in this learning material, specifically those 
        of Beryl and Jeffrey, and your own experience show this complexity and 
        the diversity.</p>
      <p> And .. we need your help here! We only can observe some tendencies and 
        patterns, which we have summarised in the checkered box on the next page. 
        We have left the blank 'question mark' boxes for <b>you</b> to fill in 
        based on your own analysis of the stories that you have read, and your 
        own experience with active citizens. The observations made on the gender 
        issue is based on women's stories that appeared in Theme 1. </p>
