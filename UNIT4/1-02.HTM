      <h1 class="grape"> Jeffrey's story</h1>
      <p>Jeffrey is from Belgium. From his story, we'll try to identify some important 
        conditions necessary for active citizenship.</p>
      <p>Jeffrey was a busy person, earning a lot of money. His family owned a 
        butchery. His parents were not interested in social work, did not have 
        a willingness to be helpful. The main values he received at home were 
        money and materialism. When he was young, he developed a passion for literature 
        and art under the influence of the Dutch teacher in high school, so he 
        went to study journalism. After two years he gave up on that because he 
        wanted to be (financially) independent from home as soon as possible. 
      </p>
      <p>He married his girlfriend, and started to work in a factory, doing accounting 
        work. His wife was a hairdresser and owned her own shop. He also took 
        care of the accounts of their barber shop. They had a good life, earned 
        a lot of money, and had many friends. </p>
      <p> But he felt trapped between the four walls of his office. He started 
        a travel agency together with a colleague, but stayed working at the factory. 
        This meant doing three jobs: his own work, the accounts of the barber 
        shop and of the travel agency.</p>
      <p>He was overwhelmed with his work. Problems in his marriage also started 
        to occur. He became depressed, and was later admitted to a psychiatric 
        hospital. He came into contact with soft drugs, alcohol, heroin, etc. 
        Then his wife filed for divorce and things got worse. He lost control 
        of his life. It took about 6-7 years for him to rebuild his life. He started 
        to feel better again and a bit more in control of his own life. He says:</p>

          <td width="90%" valign="top"> 
            <p class="quote"><b>I started to feel better and that took a lot of 
              time. And I do not know why exactly, maybe because I wanted to prove 
              myself.</b></p>

      <p> He started to rebuild his former contacts with friends. </p>
      <p>At some point he came across an advertisement from an organisation, A 
        particular foundation was seeking friends for people with AIDS. The word 
        <i>discrimination</i> appeared, and since he had really experienced discrimination 
        himself when admitted to hospital, he wanted to help. For Jeffrey, the 
        challenge leading to learning was a need or desire to feel responsible.</p>
      <p>Jeffrey was discriminated against himself, making him a good friend for 
        people living with AIDS. When he began to feel he could contribute something 
        to others, he realised his experiences enabled him to help others. For 
        example he let people be themselves and did not worry or panic about small 
        things. Various capacities (something that we consider as necessary in 
        the citizenship learning process) are needed to meet challenges and take 
        responsibility.</p>
      <p>The critical experience of oppression in his own life triggered Jeffrey's 
        commitment to become active in support of people with AIDS. He started 
        with the experience of failure, and a sense of solidarity with other powerless 
        people. He had a sense of connection (another condition that we consider 
        as important in learning to be an active citizen), a sense of being related 
        to other people, their opinions and convictions, and of being embedded 
        in a wider community. After being ill and excluded himself, he felt connected 
        to other people who suffered discrimination.</p>
      <p>Jeffrey has now been a friend to people with AIDS for about ten years. 
        He has never returned to work, because he does not want to be trapped 
        in the system again. His AIDS work has helped him to regain self-respect 
        and confidence. It enabled him to contribute to improving the situation 
        of people in his immediate neighbourhood, it gave him a sense of being 
        useful to others and enabled him to receive recognition for that.</p>
