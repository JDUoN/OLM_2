      <p><b>From Jeffrey's life, we can identify three conditions which play a 
        significant role in people's learning process, to be active citizens. 
        We call these <i>challenge</i>, <i>capacity</i> and <i>connection</i>. 
        Let's look at each of these in detail.</b></p>
      <p><b>Challenge</b> exists in specific settings, but can constantly change. 
        It can be a challenge or threat to oneself, which encourages feelings 
        of solidarity with others who are in a similar situation. Or it may be 
        a challenge faced by others, which gives one a sense of being needed. 
        There are two types of motivation: person-oriented and society-oriented 
        (though a combination of both types is often involved). Often a theme 
        important in one's personal life is also valuable for others, and becomes 
        a focus of broader social or political action. Today many people try to 
        balance their personal and societal challenges. They are active citizens, 
        but their engagement has to fit their personal meanings and aspirations.</p>
      <p> <b>Capacity</b> refers to the feeling of being able to influence one's 
        surroundings. It involves the skills, knowledge, capacities, strategies 
        and experiences needed effectively to make something happen. It is a sense 
        of agency, a feeling of being able to make a difference, a feeling of 
        being capable of having an effect on a situation. Recognition, respect 
        and support from others strengthen this.</p>
      <p><b>Connection</b> is about real connections with other people, ideas, 
        movements and organisations. It is important to be constantly open to 
        other perspectives, ideas and people.</p>
      <p>Challenge, connection and capacity do not have to be inaccessibly vague 
        terms. In Jeffrey's story, it is seen that there are many individual starting-points 
        to stimulate these three conditions in order to learn active citizenship. 
        You do not have to be highly educated or have many specific skills. In 
        fact, everybody can recognise important experiences that can stimulate 
        and improve one's activities as an active citizen.</p>
