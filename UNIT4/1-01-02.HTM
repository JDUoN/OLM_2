      <h2 class="grape">2: Personal circumstances and critical incidents</h2>
      <p>At 19 Beryl was a single mother of a young child. Later on she had two 
        more children. Without many educational qualifications, she struggled 
        to find suitable employment. She studied and later became a nurse, while 
        taking care of two young children while studying. This was a <b>transitional 
        period </b>in her life. Later on she was involved in work concerning the 
        welfare of single mothers and young children. This involvement is related 
        to her own life and learning experience during this period. She says that 
        taking care of young mothers and babies was: </p>

          <td width="90%" valign="middle"> 
            <p class="quote"><b>... something close to my heart because I was 
              a single young mother with children and I was in a working environment 
              with single mothers and their children …</b></p>

          <td width="5%">

          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Working in such an environment was also helpful for her to develop her 
        awareness of the issues facing disadvantaged people. The particular organisation 
        she worked with also had religious affiliations, which point towards her 
        religious influence (pointed out in the previous page) as well. </p>
      <p>She also mentioned about '<i>not getting on well with [her] relationships</i>'. 
        While she did not go into details, it appears that this is also a transitional 
        period. During this period, she attended classes in women and society 
        at her local college. In these classes she interacted with other women 
        coming from similar socio, economic and cultural backgrounds, which helped 
        her to develop her awareness of society (more of this in the next page). 
      </p>
      <p>Beryl's experienced a number of critical incidents: a life-threatening 
        illness, unemployment, and her son's serious accident. Just after her 
        40th birthday, she was diagnosed as having cancer, and just as she was 
        recovering, her son met with a serious accident. She was unemployed at 
        that time. She had to take care of her son who was on a life-support machine. 
        She explains what she learned during this period: </p>

            <p class="quote"><b>I saw women as carers and how they could take 
              care of their children from maybe birth, and they would be still 
              taking care of some children into adulthood depending on the kind 
              of illness that they had.</b></p>

      <p>She learned that that the carers and mothers do not get as much support 
        as they should get. Consequently she developed a self-help group because 
        she felt that '<i>we probably could help ourselves better</i>.' This critical 
        incident, and her <i>'life time experiences</i>' with '<i>disadvantaged 
        women, lone mothers, carers</i>' who '<i>find it difficult to access certain 
        benefits and things</i>' motivated her to found a self-help organisation 
        for women. For her work, she was recently given a national award for women 
        who make a major but unrecognised contributions to society. </p>
      <p>She also mentioned '<i>a bad patch in [her] life</i>.' She was unemployed 
        for 9 years, following her illness. After she recovered from her own illness 
        she found it difficult to get back to employment, which again triggered 
        her active citizenship: </p>

            <p class="quote"><b>I found it difficult to get back to employment, 
              … in the sense that my self-esteem had lowered and I didn't know 
              how that was going to be picked up again, and I think that happened 
              to a lot of people who become unemployed. Once you have lost your 
              job sometimes it is difficult so you have to go back into a retraining 
              mode and for me there wasn't a middle thing to build you up to get 
              back into the job. [People] need another [intermediate] step in 
              order to get back so I think that women in particular needed this

      <p>She founded an organisation that provided the <i>'little extra</i>', 
        a '<i>drop in centre</i>', a safety net for vulnerable women. She explains 
        the functions of the centre:</p>

      <p>At work too Beryl came across a number of transitional periods and critical 
        incidents. For example, in the early period of her life in England (soon 
        after completing the nurse training) she could not continue to work as 
        a nurse in the hospital; she became a community nurse. Although she says 
        that working as a community nurse '<i>brought [her] closer to people</i>' 
        the main reason for this transfer was that, at the hospital '<i>the hours 
        were long and the money was not good to bring up a family</i>'. She was 
        a single mother of three young children at that time. This new work was 
        useful for her later work as an active citizen. As a community nurse she 
        had to '<i>use [her] own initiative</i>' and '<i>prioritise [her] workload</i>.' 
        She learned to be more independent and resourceful.</p>
