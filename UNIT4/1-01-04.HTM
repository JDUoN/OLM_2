      <p class="grape">We have identified three inter-related factors as contributory 
        to Beryl's becoming an active citizen: values and attitudes formed since 
        early socialisation, personal circumstances and critical incidents, and 
        the development of a critical awareness of society. Over the course of 
        her life, these factors helped her to develop her <i>sense of agency</i> 
        along three dimensions: identity, responsibility, and capacity. </p>
      <p>The three inter-related factors contributed to the development and changes 
        in her <i><b>identity</b></i>. The identity is both <i>personal</i> (who 
        she is) and <i>social</i> (groups that she identifies with and the connections 
        she make). She has been taking on <i><b>responsibilities</b></i> towards 
        the causes that were suited to both her personal and social identity. 
        Beryl had taken responsibilities towards her own family, and towards the 
        groups that she identified with such as Black ethnic minorities, single 
        mothers, and various disadvantaged groups. Through her activities she 
        developed her <i><b>capacity</b></i>, learning many skills.</p>

      <h3>Learning- a transitional process</h3>
    </td>
    <td align="left" width="89%" height="290"> 
      <p class="grape">The learning process, as the story illustrates, is very 
        much an informal, incidental, and ad hoc process where a number of interacting 
        factors and critical incidents played a main role. At times she was not 
        aware that she was learning. At times, she was struggling to cope with 
        her life - so the learning sometimes was an outcome of how she managed 
        to cope with the critical incidents in her life. </p>
      <p>Based on Beryl's story, and many others, isn't it fair to say that, especially 
        in the case of adults, learning occurs in response to experiences of tension? 
        And as a result the individuals take steps towards acts of governance 
        and active citizenship? In Beryl's case, attitudes and values formed from 
        early socialisation had already prepared a fertile ground for her becoming 
        a '<i>good</i>' and perhaps an active citizen. Her family and religion 
        were significant influences. Her life however is marked by an array of 
        personal circumstances and critical incidents which transformed her life 
        - an immigrant with little formal education, a young single mother of 
        three surrounded by poverty, at the age of 45 suffering from a life-threatening 
        illness, unemployment while recovering from the illness, having to look 
        after her son on a life-support machine - all these personal circumstances 
        transformed her into an <i>active citizen</i> taking part not only in 
        the welfare of her own family, but also the governance of local communities.</p>
      <p>Her early socialisation and the values that had already been fostered 
        were important in enabling her to handle the critical incidents and transitional 
        moments in her life. In addition to learning from these experiences (informal 
        learning), Beryl also took part in a number of formal and non-formal courses 
        at the local college and other institutions. Enrolling in nurse training 
        was her first formal learning, after moving to England at the age of 19. 
        While she was a nurse, she studied at night classes in her local college 
        in order to 'build [her] education up' and for 'personal development.' 
        She studied 'the simple things - maths, English, and social skills.' Later 
        on she studied about women in society which helped her to understand more 
        about women's issues. While she was looking after her son in hospital, 
        she took an introductory course to learn information technology skills. 
        These skills were useful later when she founded the women's voluntary 
        group. Various learning experiences also contributed to her development 
        of a critical awareness of society, mostly with regard to the issues relating 
        to those personal circumstances. She both contributed to change existing 
        organisational structures and created new ones in order to address the 
        issues which she was interested in.</p>
