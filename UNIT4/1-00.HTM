        Overview</h1>
      <p class="grape"><b>How do people learn Active Citizenship and Governance?</b></p>
      <p class="grape">Active citizenship implies individual and/or collective 
        acts of social responsibility, towards others or on behalf of others. 
        Active citizenship often also involves governance, i.e., participation 
        and involvement in decision making processes that affect wider society. 
        Our main question in this theme is how people learn to take this kind 
        of social responsibility. In your work you may have come across many active 
        citizens, contributing in various ways to their communities and their 
        families. How do they become active citizens? What are the factors that 
        contribute to that transformation? You may have a lot of experience about 
        this from your own life and work.</p>
      <p>We will explore these issues through the stories of two people we've 
        met, Beryl from England and Jeffrey from Belgium. Through Beryl's story, 
        we'll identify the main factors that contributed to her learning. We will 
        also examine the main features of the learning process. Through Jeffrey's 
        story, we'll identify three main conditions that help the learning process: 
        challenge, capacity, and connections. Based on these two stories, and 
        the other stories that you have read so far in other Themes, and your 
        own reflections as you read the stories, we'll attempt to identify some 
        commonalties in relation to learning active citizenship. Finally we ask 
        the question: how can we facilitate the learning of active citizenship? 
        This will be the main focus of Theme 5. </p>
      <p>Before reading these stories, let's pause for a moment ...</p>
