      <p>Beryl's mentioned a <i>coming of age</i> in her life, and a time <i>before</i>

              to certain things and … although it was late I would probably be

      <p>The <b>coming of age</b> is the development of a critical awareness of 
        the society she lives in. She says that she was becoming '<i>more aware 
        of other things and again this is the start of [her] community work.</i>' 
        Interacting with other women who had similar experiences was key to this 
        development of the critical awareness of the society she lives in. Her 
        work with an organisation related to ethnic minority groups was helpful 
        for her to understand the racial issues in the society. </p>
