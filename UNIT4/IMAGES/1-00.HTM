        Overview</h1>
      <p class="grape"><b>How do people learn Active Citizenship and Governance?</b></p>
      <p class="grape">Active citizenship implies individual and/or collective 
        acts of social responsibility, towards others/on behalf of others. Active 
        citizenship is also linked to the notion of governance, i.e., participation 
        and involvement in the decision making processes that affects wider society. 
        Our main question in this theme is how do people learn to take this kind 
        of social responsibility. In your work you must have come across many 
        active citizens, contributing in various ways to their communities and 
        their families. Have you ever thought how do they become active citizens? 
        What are the factors that contribute to that transformation? You may have 
        lot to say about this through your own life and your work with active 
        citizens. </p>
      <p>We will explore these issues through stories of two people we've met, 
        Beryl from England and Jeffrey from Belgium. Through Beryl's story, we'll 
        attempt to identify the main factors that contributed to her learning. 
        We also will try to exammine the main features of the learning process. 
        Through Jeffrey's story, we'll try to identify three main conditions that 
        help the learning process: challenge, capacity, and connections. Based 
        on these two stories, and the other stories that you have read so far 
        in other Themes, and your own reflections as you read the stories, we'll 
        attmpt to identify some commonalities in relation to learn activecsitizenship. 
        Finally we ask the question how can we facilitate the learning of active 
        citizenship, which will be the main focus of the next theme. </p>
      <p>Before reading these stories, let's pause for a moment ...</p>
