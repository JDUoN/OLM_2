            <p class="quote">Marlene's early, private experiences were now being 
              used for public gain in the form of active participatory support 
              alongside the activities of other women.</p>
            <p class="quote">Marlene's story shows that the forms of activity 
              that are recognised as active citizenship are ones that have some 
              kind of public, collective role and ones that reach out to others. 
              It may be that Marlene's relatively passive support (letting women 
              come to visit the centre in order to give counselling support) would 
              not be regarded as active citizenship compared with more publicly 
              recognised organisational roles. Nevertheless there are distinctions 
              between her early passive and reactive life to the current, proactive 
              role she is playing in the women's centre.</p>
