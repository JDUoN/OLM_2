            <p class="quote">Jukka's biography illustrates a person who has been 
              excluded from mainstream schooling due to his disability. Jukka 
              not only lived to prove that the doctors' predictions were wrong, 
              but also to prove that he could fight back and be involved and change 
              the decision making processes in society, some of which were responsible 
              for excluding him from schooling. Jukka was about 30 years when 
              he joined the local association of disabled people, promoting social 
              equality. Parallelly, he became interested in municipal politics 
              but experienced that he could not become fully recognised, because 
              of his insufficient education. So, he restarted his schooling and 
              proceeded step by step. In January 2001, he was studying public 
              law at the University of Lapland.</p>
            <p class="quote">Jukka believes that his own private life provides 
              a rich source of experiences which he can draw on in his public 
              life, in making decisions about others lives. His own life was a 
              battle since he was 7 years old, with the disability, and having 
              being excluded from regular school for his disability. One of his 
              mottoes is that before one is ready to influence other people's 
              affairs, s/he has to make order in his/her own affairs. Most of 
              the impossible looking things can be arranged with the help of proper 
              information. And in his opinion proper information never comes by 
              itself (at least not in time), you have to apply/to look for it.</p>
