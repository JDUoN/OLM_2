            <p class="quote">Marlene was born during the wartime and was an evacuee, 
              which had a long lasting impact on her identity. The other influence 
              on her identity was the Catholic religion. She left school at the 
              age of 15 without qualifications - which also had an impact on her 
              self-identity. Marlene joined the armed forces and worked abroad 
              for four years where she met a man whom she married upon completion 
              of her national service. She gave birth to five children, though 
              within a few years her husband became violent towards her. She endured 
              the unhappy marriage for the sake of the children. When the children 
              grew up, she left the marital home and because a counsellor/advisor 
              in a women's center. </p>
            <p class="quote">As a child she was led to believe by the Catholic 
              Church that becoming a mother was the most important thing for a 
              woman. Her role as a mother, bringing up future citizens however, 
              is not publicly recognised as being an active citizen. During this 
              phase of her life Marlene obtained some educational qualifications 
              and took a counselling course to help people with drug and alcohol 
              problems. After this she left the marital home and did casual work 
              in various shops and department stores. Although she had spent a 
              large portion of her life caring for others and attending further 
              education, the 'citizen' status of these activities contrasts sharply 
              with those of some of the others, such as Mandy's.</p>
            <p class="quote">In Marlene's case she was not being driven to speak 
              out on behalf of others, her education was not overtly being used 
              to help others - but the experiences were gradually building her 
              identity so that she eventually had a sufficient sense of self to 
              enable her to look for an environment where people had a collective 
              mission to help others. She joined a women's centre. At first the 
              experience was primarily a further support to her growing personal 
              identity. She said:</p>
