            <p class="quote">Mojca was born shortly after the Second World War 
              in a rural village in Slovenia. She was brought up in a Catholic 
              family with strong Catholic values. As a child, she was brought 
              up to take care of family responsibilities, and already in her childhood 
              she felt the need for spiritual growth. The priest was an influential 
              figure in her upbringing. </p>
            <p class="quote">She always wanted to be a teacher. After completing 
              school education, she went to a secondary school for teachers. However 
              she was not able to complete the teacher training course. Her family 
              was not financially strong enough to support her schooling so she 
              had to go to work. While working she studied part-time, and completed 
              4 years of secondary education.</p>
            <p class="quote">Later she got married, and started a large family 
              with five children. She describes her family and professional life:</p>

                    education… When I was employed, it was just work and family, 
                    I could not afford any additional activities, no meetings,

            <p class="quote">Her work and her family completely absorbed her time, 
              and there was no space left for any activities outside her home 
              or her office. She however found some time to become active in a 
              trade union, and to be a mentor for a number of interns at work.</p>
            <p class="quote">The death of her husband marked an important turning 
              point in her life. First she experienced a breakdown. Her family 
              and the colleagues at work helped her to come through this difficult 
              period of her life. She learned that there are other people experiencing 
              similar situations and problems. She started to reach out to others 
              who were in need and to provide help and support. </p>
            <p class="quote">After her children were grown up, she had more time 
              to help others. She retired from her paid work, and became engaged 
              in organised public activities outside the family and work sphere. 
              Now she is active in a local society for the retired. Within this 
              society she has organised a club for lonely old people where they 
              can enjoy company of others. She reflects on her work:</p>
