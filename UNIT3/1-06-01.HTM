              organisations also recognise these tendencies in relation to volunteering 
              activities. Students are often burdened with very heavy requirements 
              in their study and in their work. They are often treated as full 
              employees and many of them work very long hours. </p>
            <p class="quote">While the level of participation of youth and students 
              is becoming a cause for some concern, participation of the elderly 
              population probably increases. Not just because of the increase 
              of the category of senior citizens in society, but also because 
              the new generations of elderly are better educated, emancipated 
              and independent than former generations.</p>
