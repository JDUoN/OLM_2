            <p class="quote">The Gypsy Communities in Spain provides an example 
              of a community whose organisation and political participation is 
              different from that of mainstream society.</p>
            <p class="quote">Within a gypsy community, the decision making process 
              is not one of a centralised process, nor are there Gypsy institutions 
              that are involved in public affairs. In this sense, the Gypsy Community 
              resembles a model of political organization whereby decisions are 
              made based on loosely organised local groups. </p>
            <p class="quote">Gypsies are a community with their own organisational 
              structure, and traditional ways of life. Their presence and representation 
              in traditional forms of politics is hidden. </p>
            <p class="quote">Following are some examples of initiatives that are 
              calling to change this pattern, and that are geared to bring their 
              participation in the political processes to the forefront of society.

              Women whose main objective is to achieve Gypsy women's active involvement. 
              They consider that Gypsy women are the victims of a two-fold exclusion, 
              as Gypsies, and as women. Historically, women have been excluded 
              from the activities in the public domain; their participation in 
              the work domain or other public spheres is limited. The Work domain 
              provides opportunities for people to take part in public-related 
              activities, and to learn new skills. Excluded from access to these 
              public spheres, gypsy women's participation has been limited to 
              the family and the private domain. Gypsy women talk about the many 
              activities that they carry out in their families:</p>
