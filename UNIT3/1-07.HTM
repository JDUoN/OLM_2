        Supporting and developing unrecognised forms of active citizenship - some 
        pointers</h1>
      <p class="grape">We began this section by asking the following questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p>Are some forms of Active Citizenship more widely accepted than others?</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>Do some forms of Active Citizenship seem more important than others?</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>What are the factors that lead to this? How do the factors such as 
            gender, sexuality, race, social class, economic conditions, etc., 
            play a part in this? <br />
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>What are the implications of the above for how active citizens participate?</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>What can be done to support and develop unrecognised or 'hidden' 
            forms of active citizenship?</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The six stories and your own experience may have helped you to think 
        about these questions. You also may have thought about how you, as an 
        educator and a facilitator might be able to support and develop hidden 
        and unrecognised forms of active citizenship. We'll summarise our own 
        thoughts below, which you might want to compare with your own.</p>
      <p>Marlene's and Mojca's personal stories, and the Gypsy communities story 
        show that there are certain forms of active citizenship that are not recognised. 
        Some of these activities are carried out in people's private lives, and 
        almost taken for granted. For example, the gypsy community is not part 
        of mainstream society, so, what they do in their own cultural sphere is 
        not visible to mainstream society. </p>
      <p>While these activities are not recognised, the experiences people undergo 
        daily in their lives can be a powerful source for them to develop their 
        sense of agency. This was the case with all the three individuals we met 
        in the stories. Marlene's experience with society and in her own family 
        life contributed to develop her as an active citizen, as was the case 
        with Mojca and Jukka. When the right time came, they all came out from 
        their private spheres, and reached out to help others.</p>
      <p>Education played a major role in developing the sense of agency in these 
        people's lives. Although they did not learn '<i>how to be an active citizen</i>', 
        two of them later in their lives embarked on learning, which helped them 
        to develop their confidence and sense of self-worth. They learned a range 
        of skills that were useful in their public roles, which we are going to 
        look at in more detail in Theme 4. We can say that education plays a significant 
        role in <i>activating</i> and facilitating people's active citizenship.</p>
      <p>What other things can we do in order to support and develop citizenship, 
        especially, the unrecognised forms? The story of the Gypsy community shows 
        a number of organisations that are specifically devoted to improve their 
        conditions and give prominence to their activities. This kind of grassroot 
        level organisations and activities can indeed play an important role in 
        supporting and developing active citizenship. We will look at some of 
        these organisations in more detail in Theme 5. Perhaps you are already 
        involved in such activities, and you may have much to say about how to 
        facilitate and encourage active citizenship.</p>
      <p>Work is an important domain in our lives, and a lot of people spend most 
        of their productive life at work, either on a paid basis or as volunteers. 
        While the work place can be a place where we can learn new skills, sometimes 
        people are not always happy at work. In some cases the workplace can alienate 
        us from being active citizens, due to the hierarchical and undemocratic 
        nature of organisational arrangements. The story from Belgium showed an 
        example of how this can be turned around, and make the workplace more 
        democratic, participatory, and nonhierarchical. This kind of rethinking 
        about how we organise work can be another way of helping people to become 
        active. You may have some examples to illustrate this more.</p>
      <p>Finally, about volunteering. Providing opportunities for volunteering 
        is one way of giving opportunities for people to learn citizenship skills 
        and enable them to be play a role in the society as active citizens. Volunteering 
        is also a means of recognising a variety of active citizenship work, some 
        of which are hidden. The Dutch story provides an example of a volunteer 
        organisation. It also highlighted some of the issues facing volunteer 
        activities, and the changing face of volunteering. As an educator, you 
        may have more to say about these issues </p>
