          <td valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="86%" height="723"> 
            <p class="quote">Jukka was born in 1958 in a rural part of northern 
              Finland. His father was a machine operator in a road construction 
              company, and mother, a housewife. He had a brother and a sister. 
              Jukka's childhood was a 'normal ordinary childhood', at least until 
              he was seven years old. </p>
            <p class="quote">At the age of seven, Jukka noticed that his vision 
              was deteriorating. He couldn't see in the twilight. (Later he becomes 
              almost blind). Because of his bad eyesight he was not able to perform 
              well in his class, in spite of his parents' efforts. Gradually it 
              became difficult for him to get into the school bus. </p>
            <p class="quote">During this time, Jukka felt that he was always the 
              slowest in the physical training lessons. Doctors found that Jukka 
              has a progressive muscle deterioration disease. Their prediction 
              was that Jukka will have some four or five years to live, at the 
              most. Doctors were wrong, and four years later, Jukka started to 
              use a wheel chair to support his mobility. </p>
            <p class="quote">Local authorities wanted Jukka to study at a special 
              school for children in a place far away from his home. Jukka refused 
              go there; he did not want to leave home and be with strangers in 
              a strange place. He was 13 at that time. Although he insisted on 
              getting personal support, he was not successful. His parents were 
              not able to change the decision of the authorities. They also did 
              not try to persuade Jukka to attend the school for disabled children, 
              which was located far away from his home. In the end, he was 'freed 
              from schooling obligations.'</p>
            <p class="quote">Later on, his brother also developed a muscle deterioration 
              disease, but his condition developed much slower than that of Jukka. 
              His brother managed to complete his school normally. </p>
            <p class="quote">Since about 12, Jukka was interested in social issues. 
              He followed what was on the radio, press and television about politics. 
              Jukka had few friends with whom he was able to exchange views on 
              society and politics. </p>
            <p class="quote">When he was about 30, he wanted to be actively involved 
              in society. He wants to influence the decision making process. He 
              wanted to be a member of the local city council. However he felt 
              that he wasn't prepared adequately for this. He had only six years 
              of formal education. He was determined to get formal qualifications. 
            </p>
            <p class="quote">Well past the formal schooling age, and with two 
              forms of disabling factors, Jukka had a big task ahead. It was a 
              challenge to find a place to study, and means to pay for it. Eventually 
              he found financial support for completing his secondary education. 
              He followed a course of study that suited his needs and disability. 
            </p>
            <p class="quote">Jukka completed the high school programme in two 
              years with very good results. While studying the high school programme, 
              he moved out of his parents' house. He moved into a purpose-built 
              accommodation for the disabled. He also joined the local associations 
              of the disabled, which aims to protect the interests of the local 
              disabled people. In that period he starts to express his opinions 
              in the local press as well.</p>
            <p class="quote">After completing secondary education, Jukka decided 
              to go on to the university. His friends told him about the Finnish 
              Open University system whereby one can study in a normal university 
              as a regular student after getting sixty credits from the Open University. 
              Once again Jukka has to go through many obstacles to finance his 
              studies in the Open University. He completed the 60 credits of the 
              Public Administration Studies, and became a regular student of another 
              university. Public Law was his main subject. </p>
            <p class="quote">At this point he decided that he was not weak or 
              disabled anymore. Education played a major role in changing attitudes 
              towards his own self. He felt comfortable to join the local council, 
              and made his first attempt. He became an associate member of the 
              local parliament and a regular member of the local community administration. 
              Jukka became a member of the city parliament, at the age of 42, 
              in his third attempt at the elections. He also continues his work 
              with the Department of the Social and Health Affairs and in the 
              associations of the disabled.</p>
            <p class="quote">During this time Jukka almost died because of his 
              breathing muscles retardation. It took a lot of spiritual and physical 
              efforts to survive. He started to use a breathing machine, approximately 
              15 hours a day, to support his breathing. </p>
