            <p class="quote">Economic conditions and work organisations provide 
              a context in which active citizenship is practised. The opportunities 
              which the world of work can offer may be reduced or even destroyed 
              by changes to the labour market. Demands for increased flexibility, 
              productivity and efficiency make it harder for individuals to be 
              active citizens in or through work. And in many low-skilled occupations, 
              the content of work contains little challenge or opportunity for 
              fulfillment.</p>
            <p class="quote">De Wrikker is an exception.</p>
            <p class="quote">De Wrikker is a printers' collective started in 1975 
              as a reaction against hierarchy and authority at the work place. 
              In the post 1968 period, lots of action groups and organisations 
              needed cheap printing. Like many other organisations developed in 
              that period, De Wrikker wanted to work more horizontally, in a participatory 
              way. De Wrikker is nonhierarchical, and all decisions are made in 
              a participatory way: everyone is involved in the decision-making 
              process.</p>
            <p class="quote">De Wrikker still maintains its unique approach to 
              work; it is a little island working completely differently from 
              other Belgian companies. De Wrikker employees' work in the printing 
              office gives meaning to their activity. The working conditions are 
              adapted to the people who work there. The business is kept deliberately 
              on a small scale.</p>
            <p class="quote">Although all over the world working people's circumstances 
              and experiences differ, their situations result from similar mechanisms. 
              Making the different but interwoven consequences of global economic 
              changes visible can be a basis for connections between people. Alternative 
              conceptions, practices and organisations of work should be encouraged, 
              not only as alternatives for individuals, but also as ways to change 
              organisations and companies.</p>
            <p class="quote">An organisation like De Wrikker can take up an 'active' 
              role, making choices about production, what is produced, to whom 
              it is sold, and at what price.</p>
