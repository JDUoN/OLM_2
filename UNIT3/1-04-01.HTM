            <p class="quote">There are forms of active participation that are 
              not recognised because they do not follow 'established' avenues. 
              A clear example is the Gypsy community in Spain. Gypsy people are 
              considered to be neither interested in politics nor active participators. 
              This is because political institutions exclude Gypsy culture, and 
              not because it is not participatory.</p>
            <p class="quote">The Gypsies are very active and participatory inside 
              their own subculture, but their participation is not recognised 
              by the wider Spanish society. The women, who are active in the less 
              visible private domain, find their contribution to building society 
              especially unappreciated. In this way, their active citizenship 
              is limited and obstructed by society's view of them.</p>
