        Overview</h1>
      <p class="grape"><b>What forms of Active Citizenship are Recognised/Not 
        Recognised</b></p>
      <p>As we have seen in Themes 1 and 2, active citizenship implies some form 
        of activity, individual and/or collective act of social responsibility, 
        towards others or on behalf of others. It is also associated with some 
        form of commitment - such as social, political, developmental - which 
        could occur in one or more areas of life (e.g., family, work, voluntary 
        activities, etc.). Active citizenship also involved participation and 
        involvement in decision making processes that affect wider society. These 
        processes of participation and involvement can be referred to as 'governance.' 
      </p>
      <p>Where active citizenship is carried out affects perceptions of which 
        activities are recognised or legitimised as active citizenship. The general 
        ideas of active citizenship, as something that is done on behalf of collectives 
        implies that anyone can become an active citizen, and all kinds of positive 
        activities towards others are considered as acts of active citizenship. 
      </p>
      <p>Is it really? Is that how the things work out in the real world? Are 
        all active citizenship activities recognised equally? Are there some activities 
        more equal than others? If so, why? These are the issues that we are going 
        to explore in this theme.</p>
      <p>We will explore these issues through stories from six European countries, 
        a collection of stories of individuals, communities, and organisations, 
        as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Marlene in Britain (story of a woman whose active citizenship was 
          not recognised until she came to the public domain)</li>
        <li>Mojca in Slovenia (story of a woman whose life course enabled her 
          to move to the public domain)</li>
        <li>Jukka in Finland (story of a disabled man who was excluded since childhood, 
          and later fought back to claim his place in the society)</li>
        <li>Gypsy communities in Spain (story of a community whose activities 
          are hardly recognised)</li>
        <li>De Wrikker in Belgium (story of an organisation that enables its employees 
          to express their active citizenship)</li>
        <li>Landelijk Buro Vluchtelingenwerk in the Netherlands (story of an organisation 
          that shows the changing face of active citizenship in contemporary society)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Before reading these stories, let's pause for a moment ...</p>

              <li>Think of individuals and/or organisations you are dealing with. 
                Can you identify instances where their activities and contributions 
                are hidden, ignored, or not recognised?</li>
              <li>Are there cases where particular individuals' or organisations' 
                contributions are more prominent?</li>
              <li>What makes some activities and contributions more prominent 
                and recognised than others? What are the factors that contribute 
                to these differences?<br>
