            <p class="quote"><i>Landelijk Buro Vluchtelingenwerk, </i> translated 
              as National Refugee Council Association, is a Dutch organisation 
              run by volunteers to provide support, education and aids for refugees 
              and asylum seekers in the Netherlands. </p>
            <p class="quote">It is an independent organisation, which is represented 
              in almost all municipalities and centres for asylum seekers. There 
              are some 400 local working groups, ranging in size from a small 
              foundation with only a handful of volunteers to large organisations 
              with more than 30 paid staff and scores of volunteers. In 90 percent 
              of all Dutch municipalities, a local Dutch Refugee Council foundation 
              is working. Every day, more than 10,000 Dutch Refugee Council volunteers 
              put their energy into working for people who have fled their countries 
              and who hope to find a safe future in The Netherlands. The type 
              of support the volunteers offer varies from personal encouragement 
              during the asylum procedure to practical assistance when refugees 
              attempt to build their own lives in Dutch society.</p>
            <p class="quote"> Recent years mark a profound change in the pattern 
              and the nature of voluntary activities, which can be seen in an 
              organisation like <i>Vluchtelingenwerk</i> which requires a large 
              number of volunteers. One of the man challenges facing <i>Vluchtelingenwerk</i> 
              is to recruit volunteers and to retain them. Some volunteers are 
              affiliated with a certain refugee family and they need to stay as 
              long as the family needs them. The drop in number of volunteers 
              and their availability is a main concern for the effective running 
              of the organisation.</p>
            <p class="quote">There is also a shift in the profile of the volunteers, 
              and the attitudes towards volunteering. The traditional volunteer 
              was someone who was faithful to the organisation and would stay 
              for many years. More recently, the volunteers is a trainee student 
              who would stay with the organisation for a year at the most. There 
              is also a shift from housewives to pre-pensioners and pensioners. 
            </p>
            <p class="quote">These changes could be attributed to the changes 
              in the labour market and demographic patterns. More and more housewives 
              are taking jobs, often part-time. Students, traditionally another 
              source of volunteer force for a <i>Vluchtelingenwerk</i>, are having 
              to take up jobs in order to support their living due to the reduction 
              in study grants. Most of them do not have much time to be volunteers, 
              although their social commitments are still maintained, as they 
              show in their trainee periods.</p>
