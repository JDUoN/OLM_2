            <p class="quote">Work can be a source of active citizenship, or a 
              manifestation of it. For some people, their work represents a challenge 
              in itself, for others work is a way to meet a challenge. It can 
              be a way of developing connections, of acquiring capacities and 
              advancing a feeling of agency and self-determination. Some people 
              learn skills at work which can be transferred to other areas of 
              life. Of course, active citizenship is more than paid labour. Though 
              for some people paid labour is their way of being active citizens, 
              others want to do meaningful and useful things after, in addition 
              to, to or instead of paid work. But some of these social and voluntary 
              activities are less well acknowledged in society. De Wrikker is 
              a good example of how work can be closely interwoven with active 
              citizenship.</p>
            <p class="quote">Some organisations like De Wrikker try to create 
              a new kind of economy: the economy of solidarity. This is an economy 
              that provides opportunities for all, including people who are excluded 
              from the mainstream labour market. The model of 'working together' 
              is an alternative to the principle of competition. This model not 
              only relates to what happens inside an organisation, but also to 
              its relations with society at large. It respects the interests of 
              all 'stakeholders': employees, customers, and local community.</p>
