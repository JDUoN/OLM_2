        Participatory Learning (Spain)</h1>
      <p><b>In the late 1970s people in the neighbourhood of La Verneda - Sant 
        Martí took to the streets demanding a civic centre (for local cultural 
        activities) and a school for adults. They wanted a particular public building 
        to be converted to such a centre. Their demonstrations included conducting 
        classes on the street in front of the doors of the building. After many 
        actions, the local people won their demand; the civic centre and a school 
        for adults was established, which is now called La Verneda - Sant Martí 
        School for Adults. This school and the civic centre offers a number of 
        principled approaches to facilitating learning and active citizenship.</b></p>

            <p class="quote">La Verneda's approach to learning is based on a number 
              of core principles that suit the adults and the community they live 
              in. At La Verneda, learning occurs in and with the community, and 
              people are able to take an active role in their learning, leading 
              to improvements in the community. The transformation that can be 
              seen in the neighbourhood today is just one example of the outcomes 
              of such an approach. </p>
            <p class="quote"> Offering equal opportunities for everyone to participate 
              is another main aim of the school. A main emphasis has been placed 
              on encouraging participation by disadvantaged people. La Verneda 
              - Sant Martí School does not charge fees to its learners, which 
              makes it possible for everyone to attend classes, without having 
              to think about the cost. In addition, the school also opens from 
              9.30 a.m. until 9.45 p.m. These long hours permit a wide range of 
              schedules. The result is that almost everyone can find a suitable 
              time to attend classes and learn.</p>
            <p class="quote">La Verneda's also uses new methods and new technologies. 
              La Verneda believes that the new technologies can be tools for social 
              inclusion, and for facilitating active citizenship, by making such 
              technologies available for its learners. The Ágora´s OMNIA point 
              in La Verneda - Sant Martí School for Adults is an example. The 
              OMNIA point is a space organised with computers and open to local 
              people at no cost. At each OMNIA point, introductory courses are 
              provided for those who have never had the opportunity to develop 
              computing skills.</p>
            <p class="quote">People's skills are the starting point, according 
              to La Verneda's philosophy. It is important to begin with what people 
              can do, not with what they can't. Everyone has skills; everyone 
              has developed their particular skills according to the context of 
              their daily lives. Active citizenship asks for people to be treated 
              as having and developing a lot of qualities that can be used in 
              a variety of situations. It is important to work with people's present 
              potential and to emphasise that they can make a difference. People 
              should be given the message that active citizenship does not always 
              require specific skills, but can be achieved in a variety of ways, 
              starting from one's own capabilities. At La Verneda - Sant Martí, 
              for example, the knowledge and skills a person has gained from prior 
              experiences is used as a starting point for learning new knowledge 
              and skills.</p>
            <p class="quote">Coordination of different activities in different 
              domains is another priority. Active citizenship can be achieved 
              in different areas, but to make it more effective the different 
              domains and levels of action (local, regional and state) should 
              be coordinated. Coordination should involve fully understood and 
              freely made commitments to participate. La Verneda - Sant Martí 
              School for Adults, participates in various activities organised 
              and coordinated by VERN, the Coordinator of organisations in the 
              neighbourhood. They are also involved in European and regional level 
              projects which provide resources for all who study at the school. 
              In addition, there are networks established between various training 
              centres for adults across Europe.</p>
            <p class="quote">La Verneda also provides an open space for democratic 
              participation. La Verneda believes that active citizenship cannot 
              be stimulated if the organisation itself does not function democratically. 
              Democratic organisations can provide space for decision-making and 
              participation. People learn more while participating than by being 
              taught to participate. People develop several skills and abilities 
              when participating in various settings. In La Verneda school, for 
              example, there is a monthly meeting open to the adults who attend 
              the school, as well as teachers and volunteers. At the meeting they 
              provide information about the activities of the school, and themes 
              and issues are debated by the whole group before decisions are reached.</p>
            <p class="quote">Breaking power relationships is also La Verneda's 
              priority. The traditional power relationship between the teacher 
              and student is one of expert and participant. The teacher has knowledge 
              (power), while the student is passive, inferior, and does not 'know' 
              enough to be able to contribute anything. It is essential to break 
              this power relationship. Everyone can contribute. At La Verneda, 
              the participation of adults is encouraged in every class, and opportunities, 
              such as interactive groups, are created which favour team work and 
              autonomy.</p>
            <p class="quote">La Verneda emphasises dialogical learning based on 
              egalitarian dialogue. Dialogical learning emphasises solidarity, 
              and takes place in classrooms which are democratic, and provide 
              equal possibilities for decision-making and participation for all. 
              At La Verneda - Sant Martí School for Adults, the literary gatherings 
              provide good examples of dialogical learning. These are weekly meetings 
              where people read a classic work of literature and discuss it. The 
              discussion which follows is open and egalitarian: everyone can express 
              their opinions. Dialogical learning through open discussion takes 
              place within a democratic classroom, where the opportunity to participate 
              and make decisions is equally open to all.</p>
