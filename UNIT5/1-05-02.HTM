        Learning Citizenship at School (Belgium)</h1>
      <p class="grape"><b>School can play an important role in stimulating and 
        strengthening the qualities and competencies of pupils towards active 
        citizenship. But to do this effectively the school itself should provide 
        essential conditions within the system. Amongst others teachers have to 
        see pupils as competent co-actors and take them seriously instead of treating 
        them as 'kids' who are not ready to participate. MAKS, part of the magazine 
        Klasse (for teachers, parents and pupils) attempts to create these democratic 
        conditions in schools and encourage children's participation and communication 
        in school. </b> </p>

            <p class="quote">MAKS is a democratic initiative, catering for 14 
              to 19-year olds. MAKS informs pupils about their rights, about the 
              offers that are available for them, to make them more involved with 
              their education and society at large. Also MAKS provides a social 
              platform to stimulate tendencies in society which lead to participation. 
              They want to stimulate youngsters to participate by giving them 
              the feeling that they have everything in them they need to be an 
              actor. MAKS presents positive images: they give examples of boys 
              and girls who are positively involved. They show that youngsters 
              are people with capacities. MAKS stimulates people by showing that 
              it is possible to realise social change. </p>
            <p class="quote"> MAKS wants to 'sell citizenship, as being sexy and 
              fun'. People need to be challenged and informed in a contemporary 
              and attractive way. Moreover the challenge should be easily accessible 
              and not threatening. It must be concrete and related to the life 
              world of individuals and only asking for a precisely defined investment. 
              It is necessary to keep the challenge 'alive' for example by campaigns 
              and repeated and varied messages.</p>
            <p class="quote">Practices of active citizenship need an 'experimental 
              space' to come about and to grow, which MAKS is attempting to provide. 
              This is a space where free initiative links up with their own experiences, 
              and capacities. There is a structure, but inside that structure 
              there is space for experiments. People, individually and collectively, 
              need to have the space to participate in their own different ways 
              and have to be given the competencies to do so. What is at stake 
              is the creation of a social support base and the necessary conditions 
              for several forms of participation. It is important to give people 
              opportunities to spontaneously take on challenges, develop the feeling 
              to make a difference and feel connected. People learn more while 
              participating than when formally learning to participate. People 
              develop several skills, competencies… when participating in various 
              settings. They not only have to learn to participate, but especially 
              learn while participating.</p>
            <p class="quote">A concrete example of an experimental space at school, 
              created by MAKS is "change your desk". Youngsters can change for 
              one day with some other student. For example: a student in Latin 
              and Mathematics can change with somebody who studies to become a 
              baker. MAKS creates the conditions to make such a thing possible. 
              The project 'change your desk' is about giving pupils the opportunity 
              and stimulating them to follow another subject at school or in another 
              school. The purpose is to prick their standard view, to awake their 
              interest in other pupils and subjects, to strengthen their feeling 
              of connection. Another example is an international exchange between 
              schools. Stories and testimonies of other people with different 
              experiences in different living conditions can provoke recognition, 
              solidarity and reflection. Exchange projects can confront people 
              with other realities and urge them to look for possible solutions 
              together.</p>
            <p class="quote">Far too often, participation in experimental spaces 
              runs the risk of being limited to a 'playground', being strictly 
              separated from the real public debate and real policy decision making. 
              In some schools for example, the councils for pupils seem to be 
              created only for the sake of appearance. They do not give pupils 
              real opportunities to take part in the school policy, but are limited 
              to an insignificant parallel circuit. Another risk in this situation 
              is 'participation compulsion': an obligatory participation structure 
              following predetermined rules and conditions, while overseeing the 
              ongoing participation of individuals and their needs, aspirations… 
              Traditionally often the challenge provoking active citizenship (and 
              the way to meet it) is defined beforehand by those who are planning 
              and carrying out the intervention. What's more, it happens on behalf 
              of the participants, who have almost no opportunity to co-define 
              the challenge or to bring forward what interests and motivates them.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="quote">School is considered to be a place where citizens 
              are modeled and moulded. The experience of children however is different; 
              most of them experience school as a place where every spontaneous 
              initiative is suppressed. MAKS aim to change this by focusing on 
              promoting skills necessary to participate in society. </p>
