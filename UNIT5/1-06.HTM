        Learning through Volunteering</h1>
      <p class="grape"><b>Page 1 (of 2 pages)</b></p>
      <p class="grape"><b>Volunteering can help people to learn as well as to 
        practise active citizenship. There are many organisations providing opportunities 
        for volunteering for young and old. Community Service Volunteers (CSV) 
        in the UK is one such non-government organisation that has been working 
        since the mid 60s with young people. CSV believes that young people learn 
        effectively, often 'most effectively', when they engage with 'real life 
        situations, particularly in meeting actual needs and challenges' of communities 
        they live in. Following are a number of CSV programmes that aim to train 
        young people to become active citizens. </b> </p>

            <p class="quote"><b>Involvement in real-life projects</b></p>
            <p class="quote">This programme involves schools, colleges and universities 
              in the UK, drawing about 45,000 young people a year. These young 
              people learn and develop citizenship skills through tackling real 
              life projects that enrich the local communities and the environment. 
              Through peer learning, they learn 'team building, positive values, 
              planned action, reflection, evaluation and celebration of achievement.' 
              Learning in this kind of environment promotes 'key skills for life, 
              work and citizenship,' 'positive attitudes and values', and a 'habit 
              of lifelong learning.'</p>
            <p class="quote"><b>Millennium Volunteers</b></p>
            <p class="quote">This is also a national scheme that encourages 16-24 
              year olds to build on their individual interests through volunteering. 
              Over 4,000 young people are involved in the UK and projects range 
              from mentoring to DJ-ing. Volunteers can give up to 200 hours of 
              their time and receive a nationally recognised certificate when 
              they finish. Some participants carry on volunteering with local 
              youth groups after being volunteers when they were at college or 
              school. </p>

              difficulties</b></p>
            <p class="quote"> This scheme aims to provide volunteering opportunities 
              for children with learning difficulties, instead of putting them 
              at the receiving end of support. Pupils with severe learning difficulties 
              at Portland School and Felstead School have become Millennium Volunteers 
              through CSV, working alongside other young volunteers on an educational 
              conservation project. The effect on pupils according to the Tertiary 
              Coordinator at the school is positive:</p>

            <p class="quote"><b>Student tutoring</b></p>
            <p class="quote">Entitled <i>CSV Learning Together</i>, this is a 
              nationwide programme launched in 1992. Currently there are about 
              160 universities and colleges with active student tutoring schemes. 
              Each year more than 7,000 students volunteer and over 1,000 schools 
              benefit from having student tutors in their classrooms. Under this 
              scheme, university and college students volunteer to work alongside 
              teachers in local schools, helping pupils with their studies, raising 
              their aspirations, and encouraging them to go on to further and 
              higher education. This programme operates through a network of regional 
              advisors and a national office providing advice, networking opportunities, 
              conferences, workshops and a range of resources. Student tutors 
              spend one morning or an afternoon a week, for an agreed number of 
              weeks, helping in the classroom with subjects across the whole curriculum. 
              Through student tutoring students can develop their communication, 
              organisation, problem solving and social skills and get involved 
              in their community.</p>
