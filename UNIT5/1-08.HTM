            <p class="quote"><b>Capacity Unlimited</b></p>
            <p class="quote"> Capacity Unlimited is a company created in 1994 
              to develop structures and manage European funds to support voluntary 
              services within the local communities. The service delivery focuses 
              on advice, guidance, vocational training and capacity building and 
              has targeted members of communities excluded from many mainstream 
              services and programmes. Within this programme, refugee groups and 
              ethnic minorities give advice on issues affecting local communities. 
              According to the programme organisers, this programme helps people 
              learn to be confident, 'a key empowerment indicator', which fosters 
              active citizenship. The organisation works in partnership with a 
              variety of agencies and institutions in the UK and across Europe. 
              Services range from project management to consultancy, evaluation 
              and research and project bidding and design. Over the years the 
              organisation has developed expertise in project management methodologies 
              and models concerning the delivery of community regeneration projects, 
              which is an integral part of the organisations work.</p>
            <p class="quote"><b>Issues facing Refugee Groups</b></p>
            <p class="quote">This category of programmes places particular emphasis 
              on issues facing refugee groups, and their integration into the 
              society. An example is a programme concerning the Moroccan community, 
              enabling the children of the community to fit in with the wider 
              society. They have set up a youth football team and mentoring with 
              help from the Scarman Trust. The programme uses entertainment to 
              encourage the young people to understand and explore their identities. 
              Providing opportunities to meet other similar minority groups in 
              Europe is a key feature here. For example, the police have given 
              funding for a trip to France to meet other Moroccan young people 
              there.</p>

            <p class="quote">Adult and Community Learning Fund, an initiative 
              within the Basic Skills Agency also has initiated a number of learning 
              programmes aimed to build capacity of individuals and communities. 
              An example is a programme to improve basic skills as an important 
              condition for active citizenship. An example is a local neighbourhood 
              project, aiming to improve the residents' capacity as individuals 
              and as an organisation. According to the project organisers, </p>

            <p class="quote"> Another project is run with the Big Issue (an initiative 
              to help the homeless) focused on supporting Big Issue salespeople 
              to 'develop their learning and hopefully move on.' The programme 
              was called Learn to Earn; Learn to Live and Learn to Work. The module 
              Learn to Live particularly focused on citizenship and health issues. 
              Building on the experience gained from this project, ACLF has developed 
              a pack called <i>Citizen 2000</i> which focuses on Consumer, family, 
              neighbourhood and law issues.</p>
