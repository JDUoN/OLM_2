        Study Circles (Slovenia)</h1>
      <p class="grape"><b>The Slovenian Institute for Adult Education (SIAE) introduced 
        study circles in 1992. They are a very popular type of non-formal adult 
        education in Slovenia. In eight years they have reached over 10,000 people 
        all over the country. Study circles enable quality time to be spent studying, 
        and enhance social capital. They also encourage lifelong learning, reduce 
        functional illiteracy and help develop civil society.</b></p>

            <p class="quote">The basic principles of study circles are equality, 
              democracy, cooperation between participants, active participation 
              and action, freedom to set objectives and plan, and freeing resources. 
              These principles make study circles appealing to participants, who 
              make decisions about their own learning depending on their own interests 
              and problems. The method gives equal importance to learning and 
              social activity. Learners explain how they take part in study circles:</p>

                    know each other, then we set our objectives, and then we prepared 
                    our plan how to realise these objectives. We acquired all 
                    the literature needed, then the fieldwork started and the 
                    final objective was the exhibition. Later we added some new 
                    elements and now it has become a kind of meeting place, where 
                    people meet after Mass, they sit and talk. I think that it 
                    has long-term benefits because it boosts the community's self-esteem.

            <p class="quote">Mentors find appropriate locations for the meetings, 
              and invite participants. They usually invite people from their communities 
              although they also advertise in the local media. Later organisational 
              work is divided among the participants. They jointly choose the 
              time, place and pace of their learning. They also take a personal 
              approach. </p>

            <p class="quote">The variety of subject-matter dealt with in study 
              circles is large. Participants can learn about medical herbs, mushrooms, 
              legal rights of senior workers, project work, organising international 
              scientific conferences, managing NGO's, the Slovenian war of independence, 
              opportunities for the blind in towns, various handcrafts, and so 
              forth. Readings and discussions give deeper insights into many themes.</p>
            <p class="quote">After learning about these topics the participants 
              transfer the knowledge to their environment. So-called 'action goals' 
              are defined in the form of publications (books, postcards, regular 
              newsletters), printed and taped materials (brochures, articles in 
              regional and national papers, guides, Websites), presentations and 
              public events (exhibitions, workshops, radio and TV contributions) 
              and other events (celebrations, food tasting, concerts, dramas, 
              excursions, literary evenings, etc.)</p>
            <p class="quote">Besides satisfying participants' personal and social 
              needs, study circles are also important for their communities. This 
              is especially true in underdeveloped regions of Slovenia where other 
              forms of education and social activity are more or less absent. 
              The group activities and learning which take place in these locations 
              have a very positive impact on people's everyday lives.</p>
            <p class="quote">Mentors and participants help the local communities 
              to develop, driven by their enthusiasm and strong will to learn, 
              teach and act. Study circles offer a different culture of learning, 
              and one which is closer to home.</p>
