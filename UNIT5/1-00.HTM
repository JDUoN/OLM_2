        Overview</h1>
      <p class="grape">As we have seen in previous themes, particularly in Theme 
        4, learning active citizenship in adults is a lifelong process. People 
        seem to learn what they need to become active citizens incidentally, in 
        social and cultural processes. These processes are informal. A variety 
        of reasons and factors, such as strong socialisation in the family, critical 
        or frustrating experience, a critical awareness of the societal conditions, 
        etc., can contribute to these processes. Challenge, Capacity, and Connections 
        are important for people to become active citizens. Your own reflections 
        may have generated more ideas. </p>
      <p class="grape"> <b>How can we, as educators and facilitators, support 
        and facilitate learning for active citizenship and governance? Can we 
        make any interventions in this regard, to an informal process of learning? 
        </b>This is the big question that we are going to tackle in Theme 5. We 
        will look at a number of educational approaches and intervention strategies 
        available for active citizenship and governance in six European countries, 
        including England. Through the stories we will attempt to identify their 
        main features and their achievements. We want to understand how these 
        approaches can strengthen the process of becoming an active citizen.</p>
      <p class="grape">In order to facilitate this, we'll first look at examples 
        of approaches from the six countries. We have collected this information 
        through discussions with educators such as yourself from each of the six 
        countries. In each country more than 30 educators and people involved 
        in communities contributed to this process. The story from England tells 
        us how a community in a deprived area learned to fight marginalisation, 
        while Slovenia and Finland provides example of the use of study circles 
        in their countries. The Netherlands provides an example of networking 
        . The Spanish story is about participatory learning in communities. Belgium 
        provides a story of an attempt to create a democratic culture in schools, 
        to prepare children as future active citizens.</p>
      <p class="grape">After these stories, you'll read some particular approaches 
        in community development and for learning active citizenship. Learning 
        through volunteering, interaction among communities and agencies, community 
        regeneration activities and capacity building, and encouraging and supporting 
        &quot;catalysts for change&quot; are the approaches illustrated in these 
        stories. We also illustrate some approaches with a significant portion 
        of a 'Training' component. All these stories come from England.</p>
      <p class="grape">Finally, based on these stories, we will identify a number 
        of key considerations that are very likely to be useful in developing 
        intervention strategies for active citizenship and governance. Based on 
        your own experience and your reflections on the stories, we invite you 
        to add to this list.</p>
      <p class="grape">Before you go on to read the stories, pause for a moment
