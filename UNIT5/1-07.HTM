        Facilitating Interaction among Communities and Agencies</h1>
      <p class="grape"><b>We have come across a number of programmes that aim 
        to encourage and strengthen active citizenship through providing opportunities 
        for interaction among different social groups and agencies. The underlying 
        assumption is that <i>people and communities learn best through interaction, 
        learning from each other. </i>Following is a number of such projects.</b></p>

            <p class="quote"><b>'Bringing People Together'</b></p>
            <p class="quote">Some of these programmes cater to communities in 
              deprived areas and housing estates. In some cases these programmes 
              also contain an element of loosely formalised curriculum. An example 
              is a weaving project, run by the Workers' Educational Association 
              (WEA) on a deprived housing estate in Sheffield. The curriculum 
              helps people to engage in artistic and creative skills and explores 
              social history and gender roles. In addition, the programme enables 
              the exchange of ideas between different social groups, e.g., between 
              white working class and a Somali refugee group. 'Bringing people 
              together' in this way can have a 'positive effect' on people who 
              are marginalised and isolated.</p>
            <p class="quote"><b>Exploring European citizenship</b></p>
            <p class="quote">This is a programme run by the WEA in South Yorkshire 
              which is aimed at community activists, to explore and learn about 
              European citizenship. The programme, now operating nationwide including 
              Scotland and Northern Ireland, brings people together through learning 
              by experience, networking and partnership with other agencies. The 
              project also has an emphasis on family learning, e.g., parents and 
              carers engaging with their children's learning and thus their own 
              learning, taking on School governorships, opening up schools for 
              broader use, etc. According to the participant who reported this 
              programme, the benefits of the programme to the individuals and 
              the communities has been: <i>'moving from alienation to involvement'</i>, 
              <i>'building relationships and trust'</i>, and <i>'increasing levels 
              of self-esteem.'</i></p>
            <p class="quote"><b>Church for Un-Churched People</b></p>
            <p class="quote">This is a programme organised by the Baptist Church 
              in Cranleigh, Surrey. About 300 people meet regularly in a school, 
              with the participation of the local authorities and the school. 
              Participation within small groups, using the Bible as a source material, 
              and linked to community projects, is expected to foster learning 
              active citizenship and governance.</p>
            <p class="quote"><b>Reducing crime through community policing</b></p>
            <p class="quote">A similar community-based volunteer programme, with 
              the help of the local authorities, works towards reducing crime 
              through community policing. This programme uses both formal and 
              informal settings, and a variety of teaching methods such as workshops, 
              role-plays, case study analysis, discussions and feedback sessions 
              to explore crime and community safety issues.</p>
