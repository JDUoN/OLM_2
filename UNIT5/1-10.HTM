        leadership skills, etc. Following are some examples.</b></p>

            <p class="quote"><b>Training for Life Skills</b></p>
            <p class="quote">One example is a programme that operates in an area 
              of social deprivation. The programme encourages people to take responsibility 
              for their own communities, e.g., through taking courses in gardening, 
              decorating, and basic skills of literacy and numeracy. These provisions 
              have enabled people to build confidence and to move away from drug 
              abuse and crime. Courses that improve life skills have helped people 
              to get back to work, and to volunteer in community activities.</p>
            <p class="quote"><b> Learning Citizenship in Europe</b></p>
            <p class="quote">CiCERO is an example of a project aimed at adults 
              to develop their understanding of, and their participation in the 
              European dimension of citizenship. This is a one-year programme 
              for 'people who are unemployed, at home with children, retired: 
              people who are "doing something locally" - as tenants, with play 
              groups, as helpers in schools, youth clubs, in schemes for local 
              job creation … .' The objective of the programme is to enable 'local 
              people to develop the skills and confidence to help end the divisions 
              in our society: helping to tackle poverty, bad housing, poor schooling, 
              racism, disability, and discrimination …' and for those who want 
              to get back to education and employment. Initial participants from 
              ex-mining communities went to Brussels to investigate exclusion 
              and citizenship in the EU context. The programme is now organised 
              as modules, which explore citizenship, democracy and the EU, and 
              social exclusion. A study visit to Brussels is included. At the 
              time of investigation, there were 13 groups with 130 people involved, 
              from across the country and different walks of life.</p>
            <p class="quote">The programme is in five sections, three run locally, 
              and two held on a residential basis at the Northern College of Adult 
              Education. During the year the participants go to Brussels to meet 
              community groups and decision-makers in the European Union. The 
              three local sections are held one morning a week for ten weeks: 
              30 weeks in all. The residential parts at Northern College are over 
              three days (two nights) and the study visit to Brussels is five 
              days (four nights). The discussions are around points such as: who 
              makes decisions and how people can make an impact ('democracy, citizenship 
              and Europe'), why some people get a worse deal than others ('social 
              exclusion'), how the European Union works and what it can do for 
              the local community ('understanding the EU'), and how one can access 
              funds ('understanding Funding').</p>
            <p class="quote">The participants share experiences with others and 
              meet similar groups from different parts of the UK and mainland 
              Europe. Modules include: Europe, Democracy and Citizenship, How 
              Europe works, Social Exclusion and Employment, Study-Visit to Brussels, 
              Fundraising. At the end of the course, participants are expected 
              to be more confident, have an understanding of the social, political 
              and funding processes which affect their community, and be able 
              to use what they have learnt. They also get nationally recognised 
              credits. The programme is free, funded by the National Lotteries, 
              the European Union and the DfES. The programme also provides childcare 
              facilities to the participants.</p>
            <p class="quote"><b>Learning Democratic Processes</b></p>
            <p class="quote">There are other programmes that focus on imparting 
              skills to enable people to take part in community activities and 
              the democratic process. The targeted participants are members of 
              excluded communities or groups. An example is a computer-training 
              programme given for 250 survivors of domestic violence to enable 
              them to interact with MPs on-line and give their views to a Parliamentary 
              Select Committee. Some of these had influenced subsequent legislation. 
              A strong community developed and continued as a support group. These 
              were the initiatives of the Hansard Society as part of their political 
              education programmes. Another programme, under the Can doers of 
              Scarman Trust, offers English language skills to the immigrant communities, 
              enabling them to build their skills and confidence to be involved 
              in the community, once they arrive in this country.</p>
