            <p class="quote"><i><b>Echte welvaart </b></i> aims to promote values 
              in our society such as equality, solidarity, empathy and care. The 
              goal is to achieve a better balance between economic, ecological 
              and social values by stimulating thought and provoking a public 
              debate about the dominant ideology of economic growth and consumerism.

                  <p class="quote"><b>We want to stimulate professionals and active 
                    members of associations within the green movement, and members 
                    of other social and religious organisations, to reflect on 
                    their role and position and on the way they bring about these 
                    values. Changes in society towards sustainability and a higher 
                    quality of life require that people take into account the 
                    interests of others now and in the future. In this campaign, 
                    we use values and concepts people accept as important. So 
                    we do not impose anything upon people. We try to trigger discussions 
                    about the values people share at work, in school, at home 
                    and in associations and churches. We "mirror" these values 
                    and ask people: "So what can you do about it?". </b></p>

            <p class="quote">The <i>Echte welvaart</i> network adopts, supports 
              and links many different activities and projects. People share knowledge 
              and inspire each other. They share common values and goals, without 
              losing their own identity. Such a learning network creates a diverse 
              and rich coalition, in which people and initiatives are strengthened. 
              The network consists of about 500 local projects, clustered by province 
              and target group. Examples of participating partners are Union of 
              Nurses and Guardians, the Consumer Union, Animal Protection, National 
              Centre Welfare Work, Dutch Women's Council, Council of Churches, 
              and Organisation for Refugees.</p>
            <p class="quote">The <i>Echte welvaart</i> has three main functions: 
              to do, to learn and to show. In the activity 'to do', the network 
              adopts and strengthens certain projects. There is strong cooperation 
              between partners, experts, regional and local opinion leaders and 
              decision-makers. In the activity 'to learn', the projects become 
              laboratories for Echte welvaart. In cooperation with scientists 
              and practitioners, changing mechanisms are studied through workshops 
              and master classes. Finally, in the activity 'to show', the findings 
              are published. The campaign's slogan is 'Seeing is believing'. The 
              network publishes articles and essays in magazines and newspapers, 
              contributes to television programmes and has its own web site. </p>
            <p class="quote">In addition, the network brings professionals, experts 
              and decision-makers together by organising master classes, where 
              they discuss strategies and methods to implement these values in 
              their work. The main goals of the master classes include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>To reflect on the values of the organisation, how they correspond 
                to the values of Echte welvaart, and how these values find expression 
                in society</li>
              <li>To inspire action in their own organisations and explore how 
                to make contact with their target groups</li>
              <li>To consider and manage resistance from individual group members 
                and change agents</li>
              <li>To integrate certain values within the goals of their organisations</li>
              <li>To gain insight into social interests that embrace or hinder 
                the values of Echte welvaart. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="quote">An important factor when considering the master class 
              method is how to bring together three learning levels (individual, 
              organisation, and society) using different working methods (gathering 
              information, reflecting on it and putting it into practice). </p>
