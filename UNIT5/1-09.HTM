            <p class="quote"><b>Can-doers</b></p>
            <p class="quote">One particular umbrella programme is the Can-doers 
              programme supported by the Scarman Trust , a national charity formed 
              by Lord Scarman after his report on riots in the inner cities in 
              the 1980s. The Scarman Trust is 'dedicated to helping people gain 
              greater power over their lives, especially by formulating new "deals" 
              between community-based organisations and decision makers in government.' 
              The underlying philosophy of the programme is to empower people 
              so 'they are not alienated from power and institutions'. The Can-doers 
              programme enables local communities to be involved in governance, 
              and help them to make a difference in their own communities. The 
              individuals identified as catalysts are resourceful people, already 
              'at work, setting up saving schemes or food clubs, getting young 
              people off the street and into sports or the arts, renovating estates, 
              or setting up not for profit businesses to achieve their aims.' 
              They need some support, such as finances and connection to other 
              networks (e.g., the local government, civil service, and other local 
              community workers). The Scarman Trust helps with resources to about 
              500 can-doers countrywide. </p>
            <p class="quote"><b>Community Champions</b></p>
            <p class="quote">This is also within the Scarman Trust, a scheme run 
              in collaboration with DfES to increase community activities. There 
              are about 150 people <i>Community Champions </i>in London. These 
              programmes enable the individuals to build confidence in their capabilities 
              and have a 'snowball effect' which will lead to more effective projects. 
              The enterprising individuals and organisations who make efforts 
              to make a change in their communities will form new 'civic networks 
              [that are] the 21st Century equivalent to the parish pump.'</p>
            <p class="quote"><b>Outreach and Networking</b></p>
            <p class="quote">Surrey Police also runs a programme to encourage 
              such catalysts, with the intention that they will eventually become 
              individuals doing outreach work with disaffected sections of the 
              community. In most cases, one person working with certain communities 
              develops a network, and subsequently becomes a catalyst for change 
              in the community. A number of outreach programmes have been initiated 
              around sexuality and ethnic minority issues. These initiatives have 
              helped the individuals to discover their hidden skills and learn 
              new skills. The individuals who were involved in these programmes 
              have experienced 'enormous personal growth after volunteering', 
              and learning has been 'interesting' for them.</p>
