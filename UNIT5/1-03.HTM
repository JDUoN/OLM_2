        Study Circles (Finland)</h1>

        translated to English as Primal Force). </b></p>

            <p class="quote">Alkuvoima was born in 1993 among young farmers in 
              South-East Finland. Its aim was to maintain the Finnish countryside 
              as a viable and enjoyable environment, and to improve the image 
              and position of farmers. The young farmers felt that they were treated 
              in unfair ways in many contexts such as in MTK (the Central Union 
              of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners) and in the Finnish 
              media. For this reason, they formed a group to improve the image 
              of farmers and other country people.</p>
            <p class="quote">Anja, one of the founding members of Alkuvoima explains 
              the functions of the organisation:</p>

                  <p class="quote"><b>We established Alkuvoima (Primal Force) 
                    group because we young [farmers] never succeeded in achieving 
                    positions of influence (in MTK). Our way of behaving was too 
                    visible, critical and radical. They did not trust us. So we 
                    too decided to act alone. Finland was then about to join the 
                    European Union - there was a very sharp antagonism between 
                    country and town. Some young women were in a similar situation. 
                    They had also experienced the loneliness of being mothers 
                    of young children, and the lack of 'soul mates' in their neighbourhoods. 
                    Then men started to join our group too. It began as an informal 
                    group, and very quickly became a kind of study circle. We 
                    supported each other, and it also became a protest group, 
                    capable of reacting very fast.</b></p>

            <p class="quote">Alkuvoima has about 40 members. Most are young farmers, 
              but there are also a baker, a diplomat, a headmaster, and a university 
              scientist among others. There is no age limit and both women and 
              men are welcome. Alkuvoima has no formal organisational hierarchy, 
              but an organic nucleus of seven women has run most of its activities. 
              The group aims to change the world by disseminating information 
              about the views of young farmers. The group has written press notices, 
              arranged street campaigns and demonstrations, met politicians and 
              contacted various organisations. </p>

                    The first was Euroopan kasvot and the second Face of Europe 
                    (The names have the same meaning, one in Finnish, the other 
                    in English.) Euroopan kasvot studied how the European Union 
                    is functioning and what opportunities citizens have to influence 
                    it. Face of Europe began by studying English, agricultural 
                    English, and developed contacts with farmers in the European 
                    Union. I suggested: "Let's send friendly letters to mid-European 
                    agricultural journals. We can ask them to publish our pen-friend 
                    advertisements for free: we want to correspond with colleagues. 
                    And perhaps they can send us some material." We sent our advertisements 
                    to eight journals in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Belgium, 
                    France, Germany and Austria. We received over a hundred responses.</b></p>
