              in Young People</b></p>
            <p class="quote">There are a number of programmes that train young 
              people in community activities and leadership, such as those offered 
              by the Civilia Foundation . The Civilia Foundation develops Common 
              Purpose programmes outside the UK and is 'sister body' to Common 
              Purpose UK. The aim of Common Purpose is to educate 'men and women 
              from a broad range of geographical, political, ethnic, institutional, 
              social and economic backgrounds' on 'constitutional, civic, economic, 
              and social studies with special emphasis on civil and social awareness 
              and responsibility in the United Kingdom and elsewhere' . In addition 
              to programmes in the UK, where over 70 different programmes are 
              run, the Civilia Foundation has helped to develop programmes in 
              Ireland, Germany, Sweden, and South Africa. </p>
            <p class="quote">Organisations outside the UK interested in having 
              a Common Purpose programme in their cities would become a licensee 
              partner and the staff of Civilia Foundation would work with them 
              in developing programmes. Local staff lead the programmes in each 
              country, and Civilia staff assist with fund raising, recruitment, 
              programme design, and the overall establishment of the programme. 
              The local staff in each country have access to the Common Purpose 
              UK knowledge base, manuals, software, and curriculum resources, 
              which they can adopt according to the local conditions and needs.</p>
            <p class="quote">There are over 12,000 'graduates' of Common Purpose 
              programmes in the UK and elsewhere. Common Purpose runs a range 
              of programmes, such as</p>
            <ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Matrix and Focus - the original city based programme for leaders 
                  and decision makers from the public, private and not-for-profits 
                  sectors (average age 38)</li>
                <li>Navigator - for people under 30 starting out on their careers 
                  - again taking a mix of people from the public, private and 
                  not-for-profit sectors, and</li>
                <li>Your Turn - for 14 year olds taken from a cross-sections of 
                  schools in their cities. </li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <p class="quote">Common Purpose programmes aim to increase the number 
              of informed individuals who are actively involved in shaping the 
              future of the area in which they live and work. These programmes 
              use a range of methods to suit the different ways people learn: 
              both by experience and through structured sessions. The Internet 
              is used extensively in helping to provide participants with information 
              on the issues covered by the programme. Common Purpose has recently 
              launched the UK's largest Website for active citizens, called <i>citizensconnection.net</i> 
              and a Website for young citizens <i>yourturn.net</i> , as part of 
              the mechanisms for learning active citizenship and democracy.</p>
