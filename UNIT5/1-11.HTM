        Facilitating Active Citizenship - Some considerations </h1>
      <p class="grape">In Theme 5 we explored the issue of <b>How can we, as educators 
        and facilitators, support and facilitate learning for active citizenship 
        and governance</b>. We have looked at a number of educational approaches 
        and intervention strategies available for active citizenship and governance 
        in six European countries, including England. Through the stories we attempted 
        to identify their main features and their achievements. We wanted to understand 
        how these approaches strengthen the process of becoming an active citizen.</p>
      <p class="grape">Many of the approaches that we have examined are not new. 
        They have been subject to the test of time. Based on the stories, we have 
        identified ten key considerations that are likely to be useful in developing 
        intervention strategies for encouraging active citizenship and governance. 
        Based on your own experience and your reflections on the stories, you 
        may have more to add. We invite you to add to this table, and compare 
        your views with your colleagues'. </p>

            <p class="smaller">Education and training can impart some aspects 
              of knowledge and skills with regard to active citizenship and governance, 
              but people also need structures to apply what they learn, and need 
              supporting mechanisms on the ground. These would include access 
              to other support mechanisms, funds, and other networks that are 
              operating on the ground. Programmes such as those initiated by the 
              Scarman Trust and Capacity Unlimited are some examples of this approach. 
              The Scarman Trust works with individuals and helps them to be connected 
              to networks consisting of local government, civil service, local 
              community workers etc., which are vital for the effectiveness of 
              an individual's effort. The approach taken by the Capacity Unlimited 
              approach is also towards helping individuals with a package of help, 
              rather than education/training alone.</p>

              support mechanisms. Coupled with this is the diminishing state sponsorship 
              of public services. Educational programmes that are geared towards 
              building networks and greater participation of the local communities, 
              such as those encouraged by the CSV would be effective and valuable 
              in the future.</p>

              sense of agency. Examples are available where unemployment has a 
              negative impact on the community involvement. Therefore future effective

              educate the future adults, as portrayed by the many programmes developed 
              by CSV and Civilia foundation. With the introduction of new curriculum 
              in citizenship in schools in England and Wales, innovative approaches 
              (e.g., MAKS in Belgium, 'Citizenship Schools' in the UK (see Alexander, 
              2001)) are being suggested as ways encouraging schools to develop 
              democratic practices in the school community. Such approaches would 
              'make citizenship an everyday experience for young people.' Educators 
              believe that 'interventions at a young age work better', and that 
              learning active citizenship needs to be continued from primary school 
              age onwards, because 'for young primary school children, active 
              citizenship comes naturally, …, then when [they] get to the secondary 
              school age, they "switch off", they become uninterested. Therefore 
              it would be important to have some kind of continuation with these 
              pupils from primary school onwards.'</p>
