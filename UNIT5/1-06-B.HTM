              the playground, on the school bus, and at the youth club.' These

            <p class="quote"> The scheme was first run in 35 schools. There is 
              a book published to promote this approach (<i>The PeerAid book</i>, 
              CSV/Ibis Trust Publication).</p>
            <p class="quote"><b>Training peer tutors</b></p>
            <p class="quote">One example is the The Pennywell Peer Tutoring Project, 
              which is being carried out in an area that suffers from high unemployment 
              and low morale. The project aims to tackle the effect this has on 
              pupils and their families, through a cadre of peer tutors. The project 
              encourages pupils to learn from their own experiences by addressing 
              problems in the school and sharing this learning with their peers. 
              Since the project began more than 100 peer tutors have been trained 
              to offer support and understanding to 1,100 pupils at Pennywell 
              School. In partnership with the school, CSV is producing resources 
              to help other schools set up similar projects. The programme has 
              a positive impact on the community, according to one teacher:</p>

                    is self-esteem. If pupils suffer from this, the need to involve 
                    parents becomes paramount, yet some parents can feel even 
                    worse. They get to a certain stage and think. "That's it, 
                    my life is over. I've got nothing to offer, just kids to look 
                    after." This work helps pupils and parents to build their 
                    self-esteem and confidence.</b></p>

            <p class="quote"><b>Volunteers/mentors from the local community helping 
              school children</b></p>
            <p class="quote">Under these schemes, parents, local employees, and 
              the wider community are involved in schools. Both pupils and volunteers 
              benefit from adults' support, in both general classroom help and 
              specific mentoring situations. Also involvement by adult volunteers 
              can 'dramatically increase communication between adults and children 
              in the classroom.' CSV has published a book entitled, <i>Absolutely 
              No Limits</i>, to promote this approach. Another scheme that involves 
              the community for the benefit of the schools and children is Volunteer 
              mentors for young people, a one-to-one support scheme for marginalised 
              young people. This project matches full-time mentors and part-time 
              community mentors with young people at risk of offending and young 
              offenders. Some examples are Bedfordshire Mentors and Peers Project 
              (BedMAP) and On-Line Swansea. There are similar projects operating 
              in Doncaster and East London. The On-Line helps up to 300 young 
              people every year.</p>
